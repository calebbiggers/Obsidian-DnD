>*Potion, Uncommon*
>
> If you drink this potion, roll 5d8. If the total amount rolled is equal to or higher than your current hit points you fall [[Conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]] for 10 minutes. The effect ends if you take damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap you awake. If a creature willingly and knowingly ingested the potion, they can remain unconscious until they awake naturally.

> Undead and creatures immune to being [[Conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Exhaustion|Exhausted]] aren't affected by this potion.
