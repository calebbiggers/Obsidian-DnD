# Four Storms Puzzle

![[puzzle-runes-players.png|border]]

The party discovered a large open stone cavern, its floor tiled with smooth, weathered stone. Four tiles near the center glow faintly with strange etched runes. Opposite the entrance, lies a sealed stone archway, its edges adorned with storm-like patterns. Inscribed in flowing script into the stone is a poem:
>[!quote] A Poem Etched in Stone
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>The Ice, Air, Lightning, and Rain did contest</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Which was the strongest, the noblest, the best.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Who was of greatest use and might'est force</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>In placid terms they thought now to discourse.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>That in due order, each his turn should speak,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>But enmity this amity did break.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>All would be chief, all scorn'd to be under,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Whence issued Winds and Rains, Hailstones and Thunder.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>The roiling Seas did toss, and the Sky look't black</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Then Lightning struck Ice, and stricken Ice did crack.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>While Rain drove Air, into yonder ravine,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>In the end his efforts were far too mean.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>For both by their darings, Rain so provoked,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>That roaring in it came, and with his source</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Soon made the combatants abate their force.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Then rumbling, rolling, and defeaning Thunder</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>As Lightning would not be so easily made sunder.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>The clamor and chaos he created with fury,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>While Rain struggled in vain; bringing only him glory.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>The world's destruction, this did seem to threat,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Till gentle Air, contention so abated</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>That betwixt Lighting and Rain, he arbitrated.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>The other's difference, being less did cease,</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>All Storms now laid, and they in perfect peace.</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Now Talos knew that through which all Storms must bend</i></p>
><p style="text-align:center;"><i>And all the Lords knew who was best, in the end.</i></p>
