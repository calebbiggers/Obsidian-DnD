# Zephyr’s Note

Within the inner sanctum of the abandoned temple, this note lies by one of the corpses.
>[!note] A Note
>To the Wardens Who Follow,
>
>If you are reading this, we are no longer among the living. The pirates came for us, as they always do. They sought us for our knowledge but we refused, as all true Wardens must.
>
>Even as we sealed ourselves within this temple, they surrounded us. Yet even in the darkest hour, we hold true to Talos. We let the storm within our souls rage, defying their demands. Not one of us gave them what they sought.
>
>To those who find this place, beware. This temple has become a tomb, its sanctity defiled by greed and bloodshed. Remember our sacrifice, and may the storm guide you to vengeance for us, and for all who fell before the Tempest’s fury.
>
>In service to Talos,
> \- **Zephyr Kaelith**
>   Storm Warden of the Inner Isles
