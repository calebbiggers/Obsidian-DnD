# Athair's Message to Gnar

A message written by [[NPCs#Captain Athair Rosewater|Captain Rosewater]] to [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]]
>[!note] A Letter
>Gnar,
>
>I didn’t want to believe it at first, but the reports don’t lie. A halfling with an eye patch, weaving in and out of chaos with the same cleverness I remember in your escape from Edina's ship. It was you.
>
>Do you understand what this means to me? Pirates destroyed our family, Gnar. They took everything we had. Every day since, I’ve fought to keep others from enduring what we went through, dedicating myself to a cause that stands against everything you’ve chosen. I’ve spent my life hating the kind of people you’ve become.
>
>I’ve done you a favor this time. I have not reported you and I have hindered the investigation slightly, but this will be the last time. You can’t keep walking this path and expect me to look the other way. I still believe you’re better than this—better than the life you’ve chosen. But I can’t keep pretending.
>
>Turn away from piracy, Gnar. Leave this life behind, before it’s too late for both of us.
>
>This is your last chance.
>
>— Captain Athair Rosewater
