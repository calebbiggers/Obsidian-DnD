>[!spell-callout] Widogast's Web of Fire
>_Level 4 Evocation (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a cat's cradle of thread or string coated in phosphorus)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>Striking both palms down upon the ground, a web of flame crackles out around the caster and five streaks of fire rapidly snake along the ground toward up to five enemies the caster can see within a range of 60 feet, leaping towards their target and exploding into a column of flame upon reaching them. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>Alternatively, all five streaks of fire can instead converge toward a single target, dealing 12d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>The fire can travel over obstacles up to 5 feet high, and ignites flammable objects along its path that aren't being worn or carried.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4.
