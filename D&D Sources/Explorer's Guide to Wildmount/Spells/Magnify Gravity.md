# Magnify Gravity
>[!spell-callout] Magnify Gravity
>_Level 1 Transmutation (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 Feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** 1 Round
>
>The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.
>
>Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn't being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot_** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1.
