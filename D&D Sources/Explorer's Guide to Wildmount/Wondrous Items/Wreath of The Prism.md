# Wreath of The Prism
>[!legendary-wondrous-item-callout] Wreath of The Prism
>*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.
>
>***Dormant.*** While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.
>
>When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast [[Dominate Monster]] on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.

>* The save DC of the wreath's spell increases to 17.
