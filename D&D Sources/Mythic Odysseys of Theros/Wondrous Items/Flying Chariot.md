>>[!dnd] Chariots
>>Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the _Player's Handbook_, but with the following differences:
>>
>>- Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
>>- Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
>>- A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
>>- If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.
