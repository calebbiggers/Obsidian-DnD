# Path of the Infernal

![[path-of-the-infernal.png|float-right|300]]Barbarians who walk the Path of the Infernal channel their rage through the terrifying power of the Lower Planes. Their fury burns with infernal fire, manifesting in fiendish transformations and hellish flames whenever they enter a rage. Whether this power originates from a near-death experience that exposed them to the horrors of the Hells, a soul-binding contract with a devil, or their innate infernal heritage as tieflings, those who follow this path embody fury that is truly otherworldly. Hell hath no fury quite like them.

## Level 3: Hellfire Claw

One of your hands transforms into a large, fiery claw whenever you enter your rage. The claw remains for the duration of your rage. If you’re wielding a weapon with the clawed hand, its flames harmlessly spread to the weapon it’s holding and wreath it in magical flames. The first target you hit with this fiery weapon on each of your turns takes an extra 1d6 fire damage.

If you don’t deal this fire damage with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed strike with the claw, provided it’s empty. On a hit, the target takes the normal damage from your unarmed strike, which can be either bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice), plus an extra 1d6 fire damage.

The claw’s fire damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 1d12 at 14th level.

## Level 3: Hellborn

At 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write either Abyssal or Infernal (your choice). In addition, you can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Intimidation]]) or Charisma ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Persuasion]]) check you make when interacting with fiends.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Intimidation]]) check you make when interacting with any creature, instead of only fiends.

## Level 6: Infernal Warrior

You gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, when you use the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action to [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes|Grappple]] a creature while you’re raging, the target takes your Hellfire Claw’s fire damage if your grapple check succeeds, and again at the end of each of that creature’s turns while it remains [[Conditions#Grappled|Grappled]].

## Level 10: Planar Conspirator

You can make minor deals with an interested archfiend or similar power to peer into the minds of other creatures and exploit their fears. You can use an [[Actions|Action]] to spend 2 Hit Dice, without regaining any hit points, to cast the [[Detect Thoughts]] spell. The DC for this spell is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

## Level 14: Incinerating Wrath

When you take damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you while you’re raging, you can use your reaction to release a punishing flame from your claw toward them, duplicating the effect of the [[Hellish Rebuke]] spell (3rd-level version, DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). You can use this ability twice per rage.
