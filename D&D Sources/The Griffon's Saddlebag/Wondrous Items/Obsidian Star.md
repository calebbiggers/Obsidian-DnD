>A favorite amongst mage hunters, this midnight-dark obsidian dagger sparkles like starlight. While in darkness, you can clearly see the cosmos in its blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If left outdoors under starlight for 8 hours, it automatically regains all expended charges at dawn instead.
>
>When you hit a creature with the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the creature is a spellcaster and fails the saving throw, it also can't cast spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level for 1 minute. It can make another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns for the duration, ending the effect on itself on a success.
