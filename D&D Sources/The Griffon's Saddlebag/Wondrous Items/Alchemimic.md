> An alchemist tried, and mostly failed, at reconstituting a mimic from its remains. The result is this vial of swirling purple liquid, which has several orange eyeballs floating around inside of it. You can use an action to pour out the vial and describe a Tiny object (such as a fish hook, ring, or quill). The description can be as detailed or vague as you like. The liquid then transforms itself into the object. This version of the object is extremely sticky to the touch, and although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic items, it doesn't gain their magical properties.

>The _alchemimic_ can remain in this form for up to 1 hour, at which time it dissolves into the liquid again. You can use an action to return the _alchemimic_ to the vial while within reach of it, whether it's in its object form or liquid form. Regardless, the item can't transform again until the next dawn or until it consumes one day's worth of rations. It can be fed the rations while in the vial by dropping bits of them into the top; doing so takes 10 minutes. Drinking the _alchemimic_ destroys it and causes the drinker to take 1d10 acid damage.
