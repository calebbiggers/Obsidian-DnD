>If you end your turn without having attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn, your rage does not end, but you take 1d4 psychic damage instead.
>
>You can enter this rage even if you’re wearing heavy armor.
>
>In addition, when you use your action to drink this potion, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
