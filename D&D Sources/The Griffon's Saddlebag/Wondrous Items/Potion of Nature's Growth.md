>The muddy slurry at the bottom of this green potion bottle is filled with plant-growing magic. The bottle itself is in the shape of an upside-down tree, with its canopy creating the rounded base of the vessel. You can use an action to either drink the potion or upend it, pouring it onto soil.
>
>If you drink the potion, you gain the benefits of the _barkskin_ spell for 1 hour (no concentration required). In addition, sunlight gives you nutrients for the next 1d4 + 3 days: for the duration, you don't need to eat, provided that you spend at least 1 hour in sunlight each day. If you pour the potion on the ground and plant the bottle there, all plants in a 300-foot radius centered on the potion become enriched for 30 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
