>This iron pauldron bears a faded healer's emblem and holds up a rugged shoulder cape. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a die to restore hit points to a creature (including yourself), you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. In addition, once on each of your turns when you restore hit points to a creature using a spell of 1st level or higher, you can grant that creature the benefits of the [[Bless]] spell until the start of your next turn. If the spell targets multiple creatures, you choose one of them to gain the benefits.
