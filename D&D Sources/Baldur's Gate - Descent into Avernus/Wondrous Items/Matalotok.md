>*Matalotok*, the Frost Father, is an ancient hammer fashioned by Thyrm, the god of frost giants. The favored weapon of the demon lord Kostchtchie, *Matalotok* is frigid to the touch and wreathed in mist.
>
>You are immune to cold damage while holding *Matalotok*. Whenever it deals damage to a creature, the hammer radiates a burst of intense cold in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.
