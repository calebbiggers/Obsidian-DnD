# Silverquill Primer

>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] Silverquill Primer
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement By A Spellcaster)*
>
>The *Silverquill Primer* is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Silverquill College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or a Charisma (Persuasion) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.
>
>In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the [[Bard]] or [[Cleric]] spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
