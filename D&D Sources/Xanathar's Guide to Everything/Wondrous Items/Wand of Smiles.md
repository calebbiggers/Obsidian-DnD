# Wand of Smiles

>[!common-wand-callout] Wand of Smiles
>*Wand, Common*
>
>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to smile for 1 minute.
>
>The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a [[Wand of Scowls]].
