# The Six Abilities

All creatures—characters and monsters—have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

## Ability Descriptions

|Ability|Score Measures...|
|---|---|
|Strength|Physical might|
|Dexterity|Agility, reflexes, and balance|
|Constitution|Health and stamina|
|Intelligence|Reasoning and memory|
|Wisdom|Perceptiveness and mental fortitude|
|Charisma|Confidence, poise, and charm|

## Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

|Score|Meaning|
|---|---|
|1|This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens.|
|2–9|This represents a weak capability.|
|10–11|This represents the human average.|
|12–19|This represents a strong capability.|
|20|This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise.|
|21–29|This represents an extraordinary capability.|
|30|This is the highest a score can go.|

## Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a [[D20 Tests|D20 Test]] with that ability. An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.
