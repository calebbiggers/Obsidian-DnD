# Poisoner
>[!feat] Poisoner
>_General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)_
>
>You gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Potent Poison._** When you make a damage roll that deals Poison damage, it ignores Resistance to Poison damage.
>
>**_Brew Poison._** You gain proficiency with the Poisonerâ€™s Kit. With 1 hour of work using such a kit and expending 50 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of poison doses equal to your Proficiency Bonus. As a Bonus Action, you can apply a poison dose to a weapon or piece of ammunition. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until until you deal damage with the poisoned item, whichever is shorter. When a creature takes damage from the poisoned item, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat and your Proficiency Bonus) or take 2d8 Poison damage and have the [[Conditions#Poisoned\|Poisoned]] condition until the end of your next turn.
