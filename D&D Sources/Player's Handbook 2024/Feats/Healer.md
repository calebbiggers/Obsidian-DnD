# Healer
>[!feat] Alert
>_Origin Feat_
>
>You gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Battle Medic._** If you have a Healer’s Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action. That creature can expend one of its Hit Point Dice, and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus.
>
>**_Healing Rerolls._** Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat’s Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.
