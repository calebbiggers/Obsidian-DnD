>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to interpose your Shield if youâ€™re holding one. You impose [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on the triggering attack roll and all other attack rolls against the target until the start of your next turn if you remain within 5 feet of the target.
