>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Enhanced Dual Wielding._** When you take the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the [[Weapons#Light\|Light]] property, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the [[Weapons#Two-Handed\|Two-Handed]] property. You don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative.

>**_Quick Draw._** You can draw or stow two weapons that lack the Two-Handed property when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
