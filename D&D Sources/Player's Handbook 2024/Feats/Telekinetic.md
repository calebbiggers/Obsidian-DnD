>**_Minor Telekinesis._** You learn the [[Mage Hand]] spell. You can cast it without Verbal or Somatic components, you can make the spectral hand [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]], and its range and the distance it can be away from you both increase by 30 feet when you cast it. The spellâ€™s spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
