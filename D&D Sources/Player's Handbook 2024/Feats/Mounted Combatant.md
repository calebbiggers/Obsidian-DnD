>[!feat] Mounted Combatant
>You gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Mounted Strike._** While mounted, you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on attack rolls against any unmounted creature within 5 feet of your mount that is at least one size smaller than the mount.
>
>**_Leap Aside._** If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails. For your mount to gain this benefit, you must be riding it, and neither of you can have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition.
>
>**_Veer._** While mounted, you can force an attack that hits your mount to hit you instead if you donâ€™t have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition.
