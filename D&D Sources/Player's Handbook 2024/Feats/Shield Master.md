# Shield Master
>[!feat] Shield Master
>_General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Shield Training)_
>
>You gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Shield Bash._** If you attack a creature within 5 feet of you as part of the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action and hit with a Melee weapon, you can immediately bash the target with your Shield if it’s equipped, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you either push the target 5 feet from you or cause it to have the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition (your choice). You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.
>
>**_Interpose Shield._** If you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can take a Reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and are holding a Shield.
