# Oath of the Open Sea

![[Taldorei-Campaign-Guide-Reborn-Banner.jpg|banner]]![[oath-of-the-open-sea.png|float-right|300]]
The Oath of the Open Sea calls to seafaring warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and traveling guardians who seek the thrill of a limitless horizon. Driven to search for adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny liberty to likeminded travelers, rooting out tyranny and corruption wherever it is found.

Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities such as the Wildmother or the Stormlord who influence safe passage. At the same time, they answer the call to hunt the monstrous creatures that too often bloody the waters with wanton violence and ill intent, and which terrorize the folk of the sea and shore.

These paladins share the following tenets:
- No Greater Life than a Life Lived Free.
- Trust the Skies.
- Adapt like the Water.
- Explore the Uncharted.

## Level 3: Oath of the Open Sea Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Open Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
>**_Marine Layer._** As an action, you channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you for 20 feet in all directions. The fog moves with you, remaining centered on you and making its area heavily obscured. You and each creature within 5 feet of you instead treat the area as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners, and cannot be dispersed unless you choose to end this effect (no action required).
>
>**_Fury of the Tides._** As a bonus action, you channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

### Level 7: Aura of Liberation

Allies within your Aura of Protection additionally are immune to the [[Conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] and [[Conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] conditions, and ignore penalties on movement and attacks while underwater.

### Level 15: Stormy Waters

You can call on the force of crashing waters as a reaction whenever a creature moves into or out of your reach. The creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.

### Level 20: Mythic Swashbuckler

You learn to channel the spirits of historic sea captains to briefly become a paragon of heroic adventure. As a Bonus Action, you embrace these spirits of the sea, granting the benefits below for 1 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
>**_Mariner’s Mastery._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on Strength (Athletics) checks and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed, it is doubled.
>
>**_Corsair’s Duel._** If you are within 5 feet of a creature and no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on attack rolls against that creature.
>
>**_Scallywag’s Dash._** You can take the [[Actions#Dash|Dash]] or [[Actions#Disengage|Disengage]] action as a bonus action.
>
>_**Buccaneer’s Reflexes.**_ You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws against effects you can see.
