# Circle of the Sea

![[players-handbook-2024-banner.png|banner]]![[circle-of-the-sea.png|float-right|300]]Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of natureâ€™s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

## Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells

When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Wrath of the Sea

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot [[Spells#Emanation|Emanation]] that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition.

When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

## Level 6: Aquatic Affinity

The size of the [[Spells#Emanation|Emanation]] created by your Wrath of the Sea increases to 10 feet.

In addition, you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

## Level 10: Stormborn

Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active, as detailed below.
>**_Flight._** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
>
>**_Resistance._** You have Resistance to Cold, Lightning, and Thunder damage.

## Level 14: Oceanic Gift

Instead of manifesting the [[Spells#Emanation|Emanation]] of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.
