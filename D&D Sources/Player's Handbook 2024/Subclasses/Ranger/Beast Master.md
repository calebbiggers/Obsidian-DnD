# Beast Master

![[players-handbook-2024-banner.png|banner]]![[beast-master.png|float-right|300]]A Beast Master forms a mystical bond with a special animal, drawing on primal magic and a deep connection to the natural world.

## Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: **[[#Beast of the Land]]**, **[[#Beast of the Sea]]**, or **[[#Beast of the Sky]]**. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is [[Social Interaction#Friendly\|Friendly]] to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.
>**_The Beast in Combat._** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [[Actions#Dodge\|Dodge]] action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.
>
>**_Restoring or Replacing the Beast._** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]], you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

## Level 7: Exceptional Training

When you take a Bonus Action to command your Primal Companion beast to take an action, you can also command it to take the [[Actions#Dash\|Dash]], [[Actions#Disengage\|Disengage]], [[Actions#Dodge\|Dodge]], or [[Actions#Help\|Help]] action using its Bonus Action.

In addition, whenever it hits with an attack roll and deals damage, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

## Level 11: Bestial Fury

When you command your Primal Companion beast to take the Beast’s Strike action, the beast can use it twice.

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of your [[Hunter’s Mark]] spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

## Level 15: Share Spells

When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Primal Companion beast with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
