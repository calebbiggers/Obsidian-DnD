>Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]]. Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 5d6 Thunder damage and 5d6 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.
