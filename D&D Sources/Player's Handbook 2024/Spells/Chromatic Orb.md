>_Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 90 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage of the chosen type.
>
>If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
