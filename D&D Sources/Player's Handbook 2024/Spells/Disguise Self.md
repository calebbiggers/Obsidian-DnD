# Disguise Self

>[!spell-callout] Disguise Self
>_Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** 1 hour
>
>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
>
>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.
>
>To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the [[Actions#Study\|Study]] action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC.
