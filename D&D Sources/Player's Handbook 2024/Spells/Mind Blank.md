>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [[Wish]]—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.
