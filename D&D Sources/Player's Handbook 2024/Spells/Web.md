>[!spell-callout] Web
>_Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 hour
>
>You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] there for the duration. The webs are [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]], and the area within them is [[Exploration#Lightly Obscured\|Lightly Obscured]].
>
>If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
>
>The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.
>
>A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.
>
>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
