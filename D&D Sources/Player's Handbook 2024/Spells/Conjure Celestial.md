>[!spell-callout] Conjure Celestial
>_Level 7 Conjuration (Cleric)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 90 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>You conjure a spirit from the Upper Planes, which manifests as a pillar of light in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Spells#Cylinder\|Cylinder]] centered on a point within range. For each creature you can see in the Cylinder, choose which of these lights shines on it:
>
>**Healing Light.** The target regains Hit Points equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
>
>**Searing Light.** The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d12 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>Until the spell ends, [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] fills the Cylinder, and when you move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder up to 30 feet.
>
>Whenever the Cylinder moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Cylinder or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The healing and damage increase by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 7.
