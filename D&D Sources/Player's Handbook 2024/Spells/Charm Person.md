>One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The Charmed creature is [[Social Interaction#Friendly\|Friendly]] to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.
