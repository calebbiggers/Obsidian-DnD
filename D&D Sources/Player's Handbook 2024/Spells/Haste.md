>Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's Speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class, it has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] (one attack only), [[Actions#Dash\|Dash]], [[Actions#Disengage\|Disengage]], [[Actions#Hide\|Hide]], or [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action.

>When the spell ends, the target is [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] and has a Speed of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.
