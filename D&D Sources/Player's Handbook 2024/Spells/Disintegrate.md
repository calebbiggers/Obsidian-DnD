>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force]].
>
>A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [[True Resurrection]] or a [[Wish]] spell.

>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 3d6 for each spell slot level above 6.
