>[!spell-callout] Wall of Thorns
>_Level 6 Conjuration (Druid)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
>
>When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 6.
