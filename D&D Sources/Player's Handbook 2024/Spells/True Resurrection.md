>
>**Casting Time:** 1 hour
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 25,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

>You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. The creature is revived with all its Hit Points.
>
>This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all magical contagions, and lifts any [[curses]] affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was Undead, it is restored to its non-Undead form.
