>
>**Casting Time:** Bonus Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.

The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).
