>[!spell-callout] Antipathy/Sympathy
>_Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 hour
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
>**Duration:** 10 days

>As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:
>
>**Antipathy.** The creature has the [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.
>
>**Sympathy.** The creature has the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
>
>**_Ending the Effect._** If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.
