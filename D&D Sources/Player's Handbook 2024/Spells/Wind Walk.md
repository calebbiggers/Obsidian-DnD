# Wind Walk

>[!spell-callout] Wind Walk
>_Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 minute
>**Range:** 30 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a candle)
>**Duration:** 8 hours
>
>You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [[Actions#Dash\|Dash]] action or a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [[Conditions#Stunned\|Stunned]] condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action followed by a 1-minute transformation.
>
>If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.
