# Call Lightning

>[!spell-callout] Call Lightning
>_Level 3 Conjuration (Druid)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a [[Spells#Cylinder\|Cylinder]] that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.
>
>When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>Until the spell ends, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
>
>If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 3.
