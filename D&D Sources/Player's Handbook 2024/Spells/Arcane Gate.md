>You create linked teleportation portals. Choose two Large, unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one space within range and the other one within 10 feet of you. A circular portal opens in each of those spaces and remains for the duration.
>
>The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist that blocks sight. They hover inches from the ground and are perpendicular to it.
