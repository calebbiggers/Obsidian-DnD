# Magic Circle

>[!spell-callout] Magic Circle
>_Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 minute
>**Range:** 10 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** 1 hour
>
>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall [[Spells#Cylinder\|Cylinder]] of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
>
>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
>
>- The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
>- The creature has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.
>- Targets within the Cylinder can't be [[possessed]] by or gain the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] condition from the creature.
>
>Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.
