# Awaken

>[!spell-callout] Awaken
>_Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Druid)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 8 hours
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [[Awakened Shrub]] or [[Awakened Tree]] in the _Monster Manual_.
>
>The awakened target has the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.
