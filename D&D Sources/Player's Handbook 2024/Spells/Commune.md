>**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S, M (incense)
>**Duration:** 1 minute
>
>You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.
>
>Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
>
>If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests\|Long Rest]], there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
