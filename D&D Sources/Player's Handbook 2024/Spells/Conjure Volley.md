>You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and choose a point within range. Hundreds of similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) fall in a volley and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high [[Spells#Cylinder\|Cylinder]] centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
