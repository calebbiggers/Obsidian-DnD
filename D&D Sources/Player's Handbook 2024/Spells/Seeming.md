# Seeming

>[!spell-callout] Seeming
>_Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 30 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** 8 hours
>
>You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
>
>You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.
>
>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.
>
>A creature that takes the [[Actions#Study\|Study]] action to examine a target can make an Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.
