>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 10 feet
>**Components:** S, M (some makeup)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if it isn't a Humanoid, if you're fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on it within the past 24 hours.
>
>The spell ends early if the target takes damage or if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or force anyone to make a saving throw. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.
