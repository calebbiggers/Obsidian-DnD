# Drawmij's Instant Summons

>[!spell-callout] Drawmij's Instant Summons
>_Level 6 Conjuration (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000+ GP)
>**Duration:** Until dispelled
>
>You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object's name on the sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
>
>Thereafter, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to speak the object's name and crush the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.
>
>If another creature is holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport it, but instead you learn who that creature is and where that creature is currently located.
