# Find Familiar

>[!spell-callout] Find Familiar
>![[familiars.png]]
>_Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 hour or Ritual
>**Range:** 10 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: [[Bat]], [[Cat]], [[Frog]], [[Hawk]], [[Lizard]], [[Octopus]], [[Owl]], [[Rat]], [[Raven]], [[Spider]], [[Weasel]], or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
>
>**_Telepathic Connection._** While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
>
>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.
>
>**_Combat._** The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
>
>**_Disappearance of the Familiar._** When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
>
>**_One Familiar Only._** You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.
