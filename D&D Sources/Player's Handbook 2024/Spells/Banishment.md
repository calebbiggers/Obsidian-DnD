# Banishment

>[!spell-callout] Banishment
>_Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 30 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a pentacle)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
>
>If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
