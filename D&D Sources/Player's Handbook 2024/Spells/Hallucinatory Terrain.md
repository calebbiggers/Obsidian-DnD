# Hallucinatory Terrain

>[!spell-callout] Hallucinatory Terrain
>_Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>**Range:** 300 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom)
>**Duration:** 24 hours
>
>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] in range look, sound, and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.
>
>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the [[Actions#Study\|Study]] action to make an Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.
