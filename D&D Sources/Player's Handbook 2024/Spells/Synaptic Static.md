>You cause psychic energy to erupt at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] centered on that point makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d6 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts 1d6 from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any Constitution saving throws to maintain [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]]. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
