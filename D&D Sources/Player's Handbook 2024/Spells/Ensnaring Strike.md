>[!spell-callout] Ensnaring Strike
>_Level 1 Conjuration (Ranger)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a weapon
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on this save. On a failed save, the target has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.
>
>While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
