# Conjure Elemental

>[!spell-callout] Conjure Elemental
>_Level 5 Conjuration (Druid, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.
>
>Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature Restrained. On failed save, the target takes 8d8 damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the Restrained target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't Restrained by the spirit.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 2d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
