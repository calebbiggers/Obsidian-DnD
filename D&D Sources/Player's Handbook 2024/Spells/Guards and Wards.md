>[!spell-callout] Guards and Wards
>_Level 6 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 1 hour
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (a silver rod worth 10+ GP)
>**Duration:** 24 hours
>
>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space. The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and you shape it as one 50-foot square, one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or twenty-five 10-foot squares that are contiguous.
>
>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by the spell's effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker immune to its effects.
>
>The spell creates the effects below within the warded area. [[Dispel Magic]] has no effect on _Guards and Wards_ itself, but each of the following effects can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, _Guards and Wards_ ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365 days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects are dispelled.
>
>**_Corridors._** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them [[Exploration#Heavily Obscured\|Heavily Obscured]]. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you believes it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
>
>**_Doors._** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by the [[Arcane Lock]] spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
>
>**_Stairs._** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as in the [[Web]] spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while _Guards and Wards_ lasts.
>
>**_Other Spell Effect._** Place one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
>
>- [[Dancing Lights]] in four corridors, with a simple program that the lights repeat as long as _Guards and Wards_ lasts
>- [[Magic Mouth]] in two locations
>- [[Stinking Cloud]] in two locations (the vapors return within 10 minutes if dispersed while _Guards and Wards_ lasts)
>- [[Gust of Wind]] in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while the spell lasts)
>- [[Suggestion]] in one 5-foot square; any creature that enters that square receives the suggestion mentally
