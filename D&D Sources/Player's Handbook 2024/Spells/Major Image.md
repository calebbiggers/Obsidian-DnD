# Major Image

>[!spell-callout] Major Image
>_Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]]. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.
>
>If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
>
>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a [[Actions#Study\|Study]] action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.
