# Sequester

>[!spell-callout] Sequester
>_Level 7 Transmutation (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** Until dispelled
>
>With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.
>
>If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the [[Conditions#Unconscious\|Unconscious]] condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.
>
>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
