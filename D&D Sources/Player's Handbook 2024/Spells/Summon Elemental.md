>You call forth an Elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Elemental Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain details in its stat block.
