# Zone of Truth

>[!spell-callout] Zone of Truth
>_Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** 10 minutes
>
>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.
>
>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.
