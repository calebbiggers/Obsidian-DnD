# Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron

>[!spell-callout] Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron
>![[tashas-bubbling-cauldron.png]]
>
>---
>_Level 6 Conjuration (Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 5 feet
>**Component:** V, S, M (a gilded ladle worth 500+ GP)
>
>**Duration:** 10 minutes
>
>You conjure a claw-footed cauldron filled with bubbling liquid. The cauldron appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you and lasts for the duration. The cauldron can't be moved and disappears when the spell ends, along with the bubbling liquid inside it.
>
>The liquid in the cauldron duplicates the properties of a Common or an Uncommon potion of your choice (such as a [[Adventuring Gear#Potion of Healing\|Potion of Healing]]). As a Bonus Action, you or an ally can reach into the cauldron and withdraw one potion of that kind. The potion is contained in a vial that disappears when the potion is consumed. The cauldron can produce a number of these potions equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). When the last of these potions is withdrawn from the cauldron, the cauldron disappears, and the spell ends.
>
>Potions obtained from the cauldron that aren't consumed disappear when you cast this spell again.
