# Simulacrum

>[!spell-callout] Simulacrum
>_Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 12 hours
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** Until dispelled
>
>You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum is half as much, and it can't cast this spell.
>
>The simulacrum is [[Social Interaction#Friendly\|Friendly]] to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short or [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests\|Long Rests]].
>
>If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a Long Rest, during which you expend components worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.
>
>The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.
