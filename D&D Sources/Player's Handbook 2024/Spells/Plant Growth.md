>**Range:** 150 feet

>This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.
>
>**_Overgrowth._** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.
