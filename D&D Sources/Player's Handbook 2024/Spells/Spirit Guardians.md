>[!spell-callout] Spirit Guardians
>_Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer scroll)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]] for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.
>
>When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
