>You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet.
>
>As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
>
>The creature protected by the field gains the following benefits:
>
>* The creature has half cover.
>* The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.
>* If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
