# Flaming Sphere

>[!spell-callout] Flaming Sphere
>_Level 2 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of wax)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
>As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.
>
>When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start [[Exploration#Burning\|Burning]] if touched by the sphere, and it sheds [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.
