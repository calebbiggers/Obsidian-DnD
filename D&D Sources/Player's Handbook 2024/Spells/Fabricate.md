>[!spell-callout] Fabricate
>_Level 4 Transmutation (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.
>
>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials.

>Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of skill—such as weapons and armor—unless you have proficiency with the type of Artisan's Tools used to craft such objects.
