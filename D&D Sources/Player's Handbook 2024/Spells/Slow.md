>[!spell-callout] Slow
>_Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
>
>An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.
>
>An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.
