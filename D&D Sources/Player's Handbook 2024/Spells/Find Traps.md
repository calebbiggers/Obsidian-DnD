# Find Traps

>[!spell-callout] Find Traps
>_Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [[Alarm]] or [[Glyph of Warding]] spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
>
>This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
