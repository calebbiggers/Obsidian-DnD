A 20-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] of [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]] appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. The Sphere is [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]], and it is filled with strange whispers and slurping noises, which can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within it have the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] condition.
