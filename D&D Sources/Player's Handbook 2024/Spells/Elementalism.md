>You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range.
>
>**_Beckon Air._** You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]]. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.
>
>**_Beckon Earth._** You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.
>
>**_Beckon Fire._** You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]]. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.
>
>**_Beckon Water._** You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]]. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.
>
>**_Sculpt Element._** You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.
