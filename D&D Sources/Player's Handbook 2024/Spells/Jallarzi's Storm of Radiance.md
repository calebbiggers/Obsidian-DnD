>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Component:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus)
>
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Spells#Cylinder\|Cylinder]] centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] and [[Conditions#Deafened\|Deafened]] conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.
>
>When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 Radiant damage and 2d10 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
