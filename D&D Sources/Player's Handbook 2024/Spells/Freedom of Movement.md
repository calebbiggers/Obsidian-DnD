>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Touch

>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]], and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's Speed nor cause the target to have the [[Conditions#Paralyzed\|Paralyzed]] or [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.
