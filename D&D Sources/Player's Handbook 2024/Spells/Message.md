>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** S, M (a copper wire)
>**Duration:** 1 round
>
>You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
>
>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
