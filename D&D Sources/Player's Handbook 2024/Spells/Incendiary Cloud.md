# Incendiary Cloud

>[!spell-callout] Incendiary Cloud
>_Level 8 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 150 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is [[Exploration#Heavily Obscured\|Heavily Obscured]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by [[Gust of Wind]]) disperses it.
>
>When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
>
>The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.
