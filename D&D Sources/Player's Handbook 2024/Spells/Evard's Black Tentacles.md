>---
>_Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 90 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]].
>
>Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.
>
>A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
