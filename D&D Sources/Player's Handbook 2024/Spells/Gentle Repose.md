# Gentle Repose

>[!spell-callout] Gentle Repose
>_Level 2 Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (2 Copper Pieces, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration:** 10 days
>
>You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become Undead.
