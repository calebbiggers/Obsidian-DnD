>Your touch inflicts a magical contagion. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 11d8 Necrotic damage and have the [[Conditions#Poisoned\|Poisoned]] condition. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. While Poisoned, the target has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on saving throws made with the chosen ability.
