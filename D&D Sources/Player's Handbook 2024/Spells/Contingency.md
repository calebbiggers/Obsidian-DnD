# Contingency

>[!spell-callout] Contingency
>_Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP)
>**Duration:** 10 days

>Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting _Contingency_, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a _Contingency_ cast with [[Water Breathing]] might stipulate that _Water Breathing_ comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
>
>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then _Contingency_ ends.
>
>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one _Contingency_ spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another _Contingency_ spell on you ends. Also, _Contingency_ ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
