# Cordon of Arrows

>[!spell-callout] Cordon of Arrows
>_Level 2 Transmutation (Ranger)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Touch
>**Components:** V, S, M (an ornamental braid)
>**Duration:** 8 hours
>
>You touch up to four nonmagical [[Adventuring Gear#Ammunition|Arrows]] or [[Adventuring Gear#Ammunition|Bolts]] and plant them in the ground in your space. Until the spell ends, the ammunition can't be physically uprooted, and whenever a creature other than you enters a space within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 Piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when none of the ammunition remains planted in the ground.
>
>When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each spell slot level above 2.
