>Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]]. They disappear when the spell ends.
>
>Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer Restrained by them.
