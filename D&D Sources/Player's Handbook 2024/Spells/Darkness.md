# Darkness

>[!spell-callout] Darkness
>_Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 60 feet
>**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>For the duration, magical [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]] spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]]. [[Exploration#Darkvision\|Darkvision]] can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.
>
>Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.
>
>If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] or [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
