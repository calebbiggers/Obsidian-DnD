>**Duration:** 1 hour

>For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]]. The sunlight's area is [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] and sheds [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 60 feet.
>
>Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.
>
>If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]] created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
