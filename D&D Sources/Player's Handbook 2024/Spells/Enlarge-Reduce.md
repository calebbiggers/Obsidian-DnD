>[!spell-callout] Enlarge/Reduce
>_Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 30 feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute
>
>For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.
>
>Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.
>
>**_Enlarge._** The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.
>
>**_Reduce._** The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4 less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
