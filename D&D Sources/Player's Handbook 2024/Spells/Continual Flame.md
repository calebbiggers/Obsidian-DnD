>A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
