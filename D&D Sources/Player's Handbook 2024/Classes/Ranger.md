# ![[ranger-symbol.png|25]] Ranger
![[players-handbook-2024-banner.png|banner]]![[ranger.png]]
Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

## Ranger Class Features
As a Ranger, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These features are listed in the Ranger Features table.
### Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells.

>**_Spell Slots._** The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
>
>**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells.
>
>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
>
>If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.
>
>**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.
>
>**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.
>

### Level 1: Favored Enemy
You always have the [[#Hunter’s Mark]] spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.
