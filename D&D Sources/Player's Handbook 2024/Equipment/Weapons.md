# Weapons

![[players-handbook-2024-banner.png|banner]]
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

>**Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
>
>**Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
>
>**Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
>
>**Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [[#Weapon Properties]] section.
>
>**Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [[#Mastery Properties]] section later in this chapter. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

## Firearms

Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

### Firearm Ammunition

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

| Name        | Damage        | Properties                                                                                          | Mastery     | Weight | Cost    |
|:----------- |:------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------- | ------ |:------- |
| Flintlock   | 1d8 Piercing  | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 40/160; Bullet), [[#Light]], [[#Reload]] 1, [[#Misfire]] 1                   | [[#Nick]]   | 1 lb.  | 100g    |
| Pepperbox   | 1d10 Piercing | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 60/240; Bullet), [[#Reload]] 4, [[#Misfire]] 1                               | [[#Vex]]    | 3 lb.  | 250 GP  |
| Musket      | 1d12 Piercing | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 120/480; Bullet), [[#Two-Handed]], [[#Reload]] 1, [[#Misfire]] 1             | [[#Slow]]   | 10 lb. | 500 GP  |
| Revolver    | 1d10 Piercing | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 80/320; Bullet), [[#Reload]] 6, [[#Misfire]] 2                               | [[#Vex]]    | 5 lb.  | Crafted |
| Blunderbuss | 2d8 Piercing  | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 15/60; Bullet), [[#Two-Handed]], [[#Heavy]], [[#Reload]] 1, [[#Misfire]] 2    | [[#Push]]   | 10 lb. | Crafted |
| Long Rifle | 2d12 Piercing | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 200/800; Bullet), [[#Two-Handed]], [[#Heavy]], [[#ReLoad]] 1, [[#Misfire]] 3 | [[#Topple]] | 25 lb. | Crafted |
| Mortar      | 2d8 Fire      | [[#Ammunition]] (Range 30/60; Shell), [[#Heavy]], [[#ReLoad]] 1, [[#Misfire]] 3. [[#Explosive]]     | [[#Topple]] | 10 lb. | Crafted |

## Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the [[#Thrown]] property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.
>**_Proficiency._** Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
>
>**_Damage._** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate for the object.
>
>**_Range._** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
>
>**_Weapon Equivalents._** If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon’s rules. For example, the DM could treat a table leg as a Club.

## Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

## Weapon Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

### Ammunition

>You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

### Finesse

>When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

### Heavy

>You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

### Light

>When you take the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [[#Shortsword]] in one hand and a [[#Dagger]] in the other using the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

### Loading

>You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Range

>A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the [[#Ammunition]] or [[#Thrown]] property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

### Reach

>A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for [[Combat#Opportunity Attacks|Opportunity Attacks]] with it.

### Thrown

>If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

### Two-Handed

>A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

### Versatile

>A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Reload

>A weapon with the Reload property can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

### Misfire

>Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

### Explosive

>Upon a hit with a weapon with the Explosive property, everything within 5 foot radius [[Spells#Sphere|Sphere]] of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

## Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

### Cleave

>If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

### Graze

>If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

### Nick

>When you make the extra attack of the [[#Light]] property, you can make it as part of the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action instead of as a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]]. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

### Push

>If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

### Sap

>If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

### Slow

>If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

### Topple

>If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the [[Conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition.

### Vex

>If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.
