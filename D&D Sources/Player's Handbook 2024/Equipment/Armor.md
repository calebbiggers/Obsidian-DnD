# Armor
![[players-handbook-2024-banner.png|banner]]
The Armor tables list the game’s main armor. The tables includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:

>**Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).
>
>**Armor Class (AC).** The table’s Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
>
>**Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
>
>**Stealth.** If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

>[!info] Variant: Equipment Sizes
>In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, an orc adventurer won’t fit in a halfling’s Leather Armor, and a cloud giant’s robe would be far too large for a gnome.
>
>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
>
>Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor, a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work is 1d4 × 10 percent of the market price of the item.

## Armor Training
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.
### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on any [[D20 Tests|D20 Test]] that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.
### Shield
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.
## One at a Time
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.
