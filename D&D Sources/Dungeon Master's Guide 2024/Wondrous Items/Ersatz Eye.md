# Ersatz Eye
>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Ersatz Eye
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This magical eye replaces a real one that was lost or removed. While the _Ersatz Eye_ is embedded in your eye socket, you can see through the tiny orb as though it were your natural eye. You can insert or remove the _Ersatz Eye_ as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, and it can't be removed against your will while you are alive.
