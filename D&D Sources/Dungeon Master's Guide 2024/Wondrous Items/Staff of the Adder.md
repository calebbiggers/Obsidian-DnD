>[!uncommon-staff-callout] Staff of the Adder
>_Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)_
>
>As a Bonus Action, you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.
>
>When you take the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your Proficiency Bonus and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage and 3d6 Poison damage.
>
>The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 Hit Points, the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost Hit Points when it reverts to its inanimate form.
