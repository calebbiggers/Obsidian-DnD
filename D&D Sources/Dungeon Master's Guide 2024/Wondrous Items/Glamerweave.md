# Glamerweave
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
>
>*Glamerweave* is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing the common version of these clothes, you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth.
>
>Uncommon *glamerweave* can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a *glamerweave* gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a *glamerweave* hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.
>
>When you make a Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Persuasion) check while wearing the uncommon version of *glamerweave*, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
