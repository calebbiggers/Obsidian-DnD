# Quaal's Feather Token
>[!varies-wondrous-item-callout] Quaal's Feather Token
>_Wondrous Item, Varies_
>
>This object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The DM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Quaal's Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.

>You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.
>
>#### Bird (Rare)
>
>You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a [[Roc]], but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action.
>
>#### Fan (Uncommon)
>
>If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action.
>
>#### Swan Boat (Rare)
>
>You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action.
>
>#### Tree (Uncommon)
>
>You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
>
>#### Whip (Rare)
>
>You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
>
>As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition.
