# Manual of Gainful Exercise
>[!varies-wondrous-item-callout] Manual of Gainful Exercise
>_Wondrous Item, Varies_
>
>This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.
