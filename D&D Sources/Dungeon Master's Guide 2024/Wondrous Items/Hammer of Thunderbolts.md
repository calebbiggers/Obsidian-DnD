>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

>The weapon has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, hurling it as if it had the [[Weapons#Thrown\|Thrown]] property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Stunned\|Stunned]] condition until the end of your next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
