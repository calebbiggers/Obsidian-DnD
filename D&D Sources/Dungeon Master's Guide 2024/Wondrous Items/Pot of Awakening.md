>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Pot of Awakening
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [[Awakened Shrub]] at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.
>
>The awakened shrub is [[Social Interaction#Friendly\|Friendly]] toward you and obeys your commands. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
