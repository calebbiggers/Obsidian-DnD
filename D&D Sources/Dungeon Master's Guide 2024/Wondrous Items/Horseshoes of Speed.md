# Horseshoes of Speed
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] Horseshoes of Speed
>_Wondrous Item, Rare_
>
>These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action.
>
>While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.
