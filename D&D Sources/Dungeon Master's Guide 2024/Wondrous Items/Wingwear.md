# Wingwear
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This snug uniform has symbols of air stitched into it and leathery flaps that stretch along the arms, waist, and legs to create wings for gliding. A suit of *Wingwear* has 3 charges. While you wear the suit, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until you land. At the end of each of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didnâ€™t fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet, you land (or fall), and you must expend another charge to use the suit again.
>
>The suit regains all of its expended charges after spending at least 1 hour in an elemental air node.
