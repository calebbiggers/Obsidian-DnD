# Potion of Mind Control
>[!rarity-varies-potion-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Potion, Rarity Varies*
>
>When you drink a *Potion of Mind Control*, you can cast a *Dominate* spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.
>
>A *Potion of Mind Control* produces the effect of a [[Dominate Beast]], a [[Dominate Person]] (humanoid), or a [[Dominate Monster]] spell (see the table below). If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The charmed creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
