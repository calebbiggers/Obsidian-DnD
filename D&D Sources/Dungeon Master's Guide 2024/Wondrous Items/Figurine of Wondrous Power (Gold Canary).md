>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a golden statuettes of a canary. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a **giant canary**. If the space where the canary would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the canary, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>The canary is friendly to you and your companions and can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. 
>
>The canary exists for up to 8 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until the next dawn.
