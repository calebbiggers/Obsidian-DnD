>This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can strike the chime to cast [[Knock]]. The spell's customary knocking sound is replaced by the clear, ringing tone of the chime, which is audible out to 300 feet.
>
>The chime can be used 10 times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.
