>[!varies-wondrous-item-callout] Instrument of the Bards
>_Wondrous Item, Varies (Requires Attunement a Bard)_
>
>An _Instrument of the Bards_ is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. The Instruments of the Bards table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 Psychic damage.

>Instruments of the Bards (Canaith Mandolin, Cli Lyre, Anstruth Harp,  
>Ollamh Harp, Fochlucan Bandore, Doss lute, Mac-Fuirmidh cittern)
>
>You can play the instrument to cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
