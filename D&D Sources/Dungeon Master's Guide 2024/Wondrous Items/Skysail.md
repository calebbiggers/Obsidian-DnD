# Skysail
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] Skysail
>![[sky-sail.png]]
>*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>These bat-like wings were first used by the Air Ashari to soar through the sky. They are constructed of either leather and bone, or cloth and wood, and are set onto a sturdy wooden pole that helps their user remain stable during flight.
>
>While these wings are open and you are riding the *skysail*, you can glide through the air. You have a flying speed of 60 feet, but you must descend at least 10 feet by the end of each of your turns and you can’t gain altitude.
>
>Additionally, while in contact with the *skysail*, you can use an action to cast the [[Fly]] spell on yourself, with a duration of 1 minute and requiring no concentration. The spell ends if you lose physical contact with the *skysail*. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn, or unless the *skysail* is immersed in powerful magic of elemental air. (This includes magic such as that found at the top of the Summit Peaks near the rift of air in Zephrah, or on the Elemental Plane of Air).
>
>When the *skysail* is not in use, its wings can be retracted, and its pole can be used as a quarterstaff.
