>You can take a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action to place these shackles on a creature that has the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.
>
>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
