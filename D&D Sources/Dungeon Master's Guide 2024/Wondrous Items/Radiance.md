# Radiance
>[!unknown-rarity-wand-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wand, Unknown Rarity (Requires Attunement By A Spellcaster)*
>
>While holding this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. Radiance is in the form of an exquisite golden hand mirror.
>
>While surrounded by darkness, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that is attuned to Radiance can use a bonus action while holding the mirror to cast the [[Enhance Ability]] spell, choosing itself and no other creature as the spell's target. Once this property of the wand is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
