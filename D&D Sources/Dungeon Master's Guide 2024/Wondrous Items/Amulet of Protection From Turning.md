>While you wear this amulet of silver and turquoise, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
>
>If you fail a saving throw against such an effect, you can choose to succeed instead. You can do so three times, and expended uses recharge daily at dawn.
>
>Each time an effect that turns undead is used against you, the amulet glows with silvery blue light for a few seconds.
