# Gurt's Greataxe
>[!legendary-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Greataxe), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), the frost giant lord Gurt fell to Uthgar Gardolfsson-leader of the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbarians-in a battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin Valley. *Gurt's Greataxe* was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it.

>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human.
>
>The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions.
>
>As an action, you can cast a version of the [[Heat Metal]] spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
