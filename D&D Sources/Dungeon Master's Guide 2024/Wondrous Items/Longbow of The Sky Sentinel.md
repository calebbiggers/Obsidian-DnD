# Longbow of The Sky Sentinel
>[!unknown-rarity-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Longbow), Unknown Rarity (Requires Attunement)*
>
>The bow is very well-crafted with elvish designs. There are bits of mithral scrolling throughout the bow itself and platinum caps on the ends.
>
>Once per long rest, the wielder can use a Storm Arrow, which splits the next arrow fired from the bow into three separate arrows. Each arrow that hits deals an extra 1d6 Lightning damage.
>
>If a magical arrow is shot from the Longbow, the two additional arrows would not copy its effects. However, each arrow can trigger Hunter's Mark damage independently. For example, the [[Blazing Bowstring]] can be used to add 1d10 fire damage to the initial arrow, but it does not affect the two additional arrows.
