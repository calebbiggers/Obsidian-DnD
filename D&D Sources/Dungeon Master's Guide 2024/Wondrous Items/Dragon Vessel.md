>**Slumbering (Uncommon).** As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): Ale, Olive Oil, a [[Potion of Healing]], or a [[Potion of Climbing 1]]. Once this property is used, it can’t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn’t imbibed within 24 hours.
