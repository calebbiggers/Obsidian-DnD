# Figurine of Wondrous Power (Golden Lions)
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*`=this.type`, `=this.rarity`*
>
>These *Figurines of Wondrous Power* are a pair gold statuettes of lions. They are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the lion would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the lion, the figurine doesn't become a creature.
>
>The lion is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's statistics.
>
>The lion exists for up to 1 hour. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
