>Created by the stone giant librarians of Gravenhollow. this nineteen-inch-long shard of quartz grants you advantage on Intelligence (investigation) checks while it is on your person.
>
>The crystal has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to east one of the following spells from it: *[[Speak with Animals]]* (2 charges), *[[Speak with Dead]]* (4 charges), or *[[Speak with Plants]]* (3 charges).
>
>When you cast a divination spell, you can use the crystal in place of one material component that would normally be consumed by the spell, at a cost of 1 charge per level of the spell. The crystal is not consumed when used in this way.
>
>The crystal regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the crystal's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal vanishes, lost forever.
