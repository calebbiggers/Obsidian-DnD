>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This finely carved pipe blows odorless bubbles instead of smoke when used. The pipe has 3 charges, and it regains all spent charges daily at dawn. While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties:
>
>* You can cast [[Fog Cloud]] as an action (1 charge).
>* You can cast [[Misty Step]] as a bonus action (2 charges).
>* You can summon a steam mephit as an action (3 charges). The mephit is friendly to you, obeys your verbal commands, and acts on its own turn in the initiative order. It disappears in a harmless puff of steam after 1 minute or if it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the pipe.
