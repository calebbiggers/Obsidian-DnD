# Whelm
>[!artifact-weapon-callout] Whelm
>_Weapon (Warhammer) , Artifact (Requires Attunement a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt of Dwarvenkind)_
>
>_Whelm_ is a powerful weapon forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.
>
>You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
>
>**_Hurl._** _Whelm_ has the [[Weapons#Thrown\|Thrown]] property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack roll using _Whelm_, the target takes an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 4d8 Force damage if the target is a Construct, an Elemental, or a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.
>
>**_Shock Wave._** You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to strike the ground with _Whelm_ and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Stunned\|Stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
>
>**_Supernatural Awareness._** While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can cast [[Detect Evil and Good]] or [[Locate Object]] from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.
>
>**_Sentience._** _Whelm_ is a sentient, Lawful Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [[Exploration#Darkvision\|Darkvision]] out to 120 feet.
>
>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin.
>
>**_Personality._** _Whelm_ has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. _Whelm_'s purpose is to protect dwarves. Conflict arises if the wielder doesn't share this goal.
>
>**_Destroying Whelm._** _Whelm_ can be dissolved in the acidic bile of a recently slain [[ancient black dragon]]. It can also be melted down in the forges of the Mightyhammer dwarf clan, but only by the rightful leader of that clan.
