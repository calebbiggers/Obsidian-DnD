>[!common-wand-callout] Wand of Conducting
>_Wand, Common_
>
>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
