# Ring of Shooting Stars
>[!varies-ring-callout] Ring of Shooting Stars
>_Ring, Varies (Requires Attunement)_
>
>You can cast [[Dancing Lights]] or [[Weapons#Light\|Light]] from the ring.
>
>The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.
>
>**_Faerie Fire._** You can expend 1 charge to cast [[Faerie Fire]] from the ring.
>
>**_Lightning Spheres._** You can expend 2 charges as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.
>
>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] in a 30-foot radius.
>
>As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind [[Combat#Total Cover\|Total Cover]], the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
>
>|Number of Spheres|Lightning Damage|
>|---|---|
>|1|4d12|
>|2|5d4|
>|3|2d6|
>|4|2d4|
>
>**_Shooting Stars._** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
