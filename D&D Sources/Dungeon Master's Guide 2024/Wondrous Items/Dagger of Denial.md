# Dagger of Denial
>[!rare-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Dagger), Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This silver stiletto blade bears intricate grooves that spiral from its tip to its ivory hilt and handle. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
>
>As an action, you can place the point of the blade into any keyhole and seal it shut. A keyhole sealed in this way can't be unlocked until this dagger is placed into that keyhole once more (though a sealed door or container can still be broken, bypassing the lock). Sealing a keyhole unseals any keyholes previously sealed with this weapon.
