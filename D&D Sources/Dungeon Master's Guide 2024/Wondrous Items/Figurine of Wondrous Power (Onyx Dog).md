>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a onyx statuettes of an dog. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a **mastiff**. If the space where the elephant would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the elephant, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range.
>
>The mastiff exists for up to 6 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
