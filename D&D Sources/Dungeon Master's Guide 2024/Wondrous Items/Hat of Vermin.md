>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Hat of Vermin
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [[Bat]], a [[Frog]], or a [[Rat]]. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [[Social Interaction#Indifferent\|Indifferent]] toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
