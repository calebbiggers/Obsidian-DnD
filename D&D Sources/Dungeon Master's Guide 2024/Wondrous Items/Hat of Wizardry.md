>This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use the hat as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.
>
>**_Unknown Spell._** As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a Long Rest.
