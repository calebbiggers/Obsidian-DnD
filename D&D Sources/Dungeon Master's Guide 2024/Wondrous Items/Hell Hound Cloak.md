# Hell Hound Cloak
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This dark cloak is made of cured hell hound hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a **hell hound** for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the [[Polymorph]] spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form.
>
>***Curse.*** This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hell hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with [[Remove Curse]] or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times.
>
>The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to 0 hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in hell hound form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a hell hound. Thereafter, only [[Remove Curse]] or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.
