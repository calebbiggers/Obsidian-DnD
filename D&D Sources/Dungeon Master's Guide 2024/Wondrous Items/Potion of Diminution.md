>[!rare-potion-callout] Potion of Diminution
>_Potion, Rare_
>
>When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell for 1d4 hours (no [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]] required).
>
>The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
