>
>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:
>
>**First Command Word.** The gem sheds [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
>
>**Second Command Word.** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
>**Third Command Word.** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot [[Spells#Cone\|Cone]]. Each creature in the [[Spells#Cone\|Cone]] makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.
>
>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.
