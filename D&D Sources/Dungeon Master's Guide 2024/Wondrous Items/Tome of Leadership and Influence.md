# Tome of Leadership and Influence
>[!varies-wondrous-item-callout] Tome of Leadership and Influence
>_Wondrous Item, Varies_
>
>This book contains guidelines for influencing and charming others, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.
