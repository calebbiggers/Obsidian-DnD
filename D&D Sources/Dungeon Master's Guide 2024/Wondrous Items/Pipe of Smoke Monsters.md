# Pipe of Smoke Monsters
>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Pipe of Smoke Monsters
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>While smoking this pipe, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a slaad. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
