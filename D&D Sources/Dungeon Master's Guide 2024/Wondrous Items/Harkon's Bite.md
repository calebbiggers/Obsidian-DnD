# Harkon's Bite
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*
>
>A dire wolf tooth dangles from this simple cord necklace. While you wear it, the necklace grants you a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.
>
>**Curse.** Attuning to *Harkon's Bite* curses you until either Harkon Lukas removes the necklace from you or you are targeted by a [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot remove the necklace.
>
>Upon donning or removing the necklace, whether you are attuned to it or not, you are afflicted with werewolf lycanthropy as detailed in the *Monster Manual*. The curse lasts until the dawn after the next full moon. If you are still wearing the necklace at this time, you are afflicted with lycanthropy again.
