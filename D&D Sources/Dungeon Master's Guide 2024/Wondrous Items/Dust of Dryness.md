# Dust of Dryness
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] Dust of Dryness
>_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_
>
>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. As a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

>As a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a [[Water Elemental]] or a [[Water Weird]]). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
