# Wand of Enemy Detection
>[!rare-wand-callout] Wand of Enemy Detection
>_Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement)_
>
>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [[Social Interaction#Hostile\|Hostile]] to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of Hostile creatures that are [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]], ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
