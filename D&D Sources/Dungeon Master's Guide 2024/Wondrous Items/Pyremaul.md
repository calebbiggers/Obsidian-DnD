>*Weapon (Maul), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon, somewhere beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains.
>
>***Dormant.*** While *Pyremaul* is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage.
>
>Additionally, you can choose to have this weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (no action required).
>
>***Awakened.*** When *Pyremaul* reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack rolls increases to +2.
>* The extra fire damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.
>* As an action, you can slam *Pyremaul* into the ground to cast the [[Burning Hands]] spell at 2nd level (save DC 15). You can’t use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.
>* Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
>***Exalted.*** When *Pyremaul* reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack rolls increases to +3.
>* The extra fire damage dealt by the weapon increases to 3d6.
>* When you cast [[Burning Hands]] with the weapon, you do so at 3rd level and the save DC increases to 17.
>* When you score a critical hit with this weapon, the saving throw to avoid being knocked prone increases to 17. You also roll an extra 3d6 fire damage when determining the extra damage for the critical hit.
>* When you kill a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can take 10d10 fire damage and immolate the creature’s corpse. This damage can’t be reduced in any way, and you die if this damage reduces you to 0 hit points. The immolated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of ash. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[True Resurrection]] or a [[Wish]] spell. You can’t use this property of the maul again until 7 days have passed.
