# Scroll of Titan Summoning
>[!legendary-scroll-callout] Scroll of Titan Summoning
>_Scroll, Legendary_
>
>When you take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below (see the _Monster Manual_ for the creature's stat block).
>
>The titan is [[Social Interaction#Hostile\|Hostile]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
