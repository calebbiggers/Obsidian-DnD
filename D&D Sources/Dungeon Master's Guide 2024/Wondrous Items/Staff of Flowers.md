# Staff of Flowers
>[!common-staff-callout] Staff of Flowers
>_Staff, Common_
>
>This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.
