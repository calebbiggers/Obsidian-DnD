>*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
>
>The reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the *talarith*, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits.
>
>As an action, a reigar can use its *talarith* to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn't have a *talarith* of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.
