# Well of Many Worlds
>[!legendary-wondrous-item-callout] Well of Many Worlds
>_Wondrous Item, Legendary_
>
>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
>
>You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to unfold the _Well of Many Worlds_ and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.
>
>Once the _Well of Many Worlds_ has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.
