# Necklace of Fireballs
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] Necklace of Fireballs
>_Wondrous Item, Rare_
>
>This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 [[Fireball]] (save DC 15).
>
>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the [[Fireball]] by 1d6 for each bead after the first (maximum 12d6).
