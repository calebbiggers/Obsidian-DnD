# Smokepowder
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
>
>*Smokepowder* is a magical explosive chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a firearm. It is stored in airtight wooden kegs or tiny, waterproof leather packets. A packet contains enough *Smokepowder* for five shots, and a keg holds enough *Smokepowder* for five hundred shots.
>
>If *Smokepowder* is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.
>
>Casting [[Dispel Magic]] on *Smokepowder* renders it permanently inert.
