# Blade of Ledros
>[!rare-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Longsword), Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>The jagged shards of this blade are bound together by sickly green energy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
>
>When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, the humanoid takes an extra 3d6 damage.
>
>***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with [[Remove Curse]] or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.
>
>While you are attuned to the sword, once a day at midnight, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw unless you are undead. On a failed save, your maximum hit points are reduced by 10. Hit points lost in this way can only be restored by a [[Wish]] spell. If your maximum hit points are reduced to 0 in this way, you die and immediately rise as a wraith.
