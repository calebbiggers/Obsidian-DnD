# Bottled Breath
>[!uncommon-potion-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Potion, Uncommon*
>
>This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.
>
>If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the [[Gust of Wind]] spell. If you hold the breath, you don’t need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn’t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.
