# Staff of the Python
>[!uncommon-staff-callout] Staff of the Python
>_Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)_
>
>As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can throw this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the staff to become a [[Giant Constrictor Snake]] in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.
>
>On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.
>
>As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.
