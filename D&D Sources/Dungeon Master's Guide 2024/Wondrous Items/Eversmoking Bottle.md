# Eversmoking Bottle

>_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_
>
>As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can open or close this bottle.
>
>Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]] originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is [[Exploration#Heavily Obscured\|Heavily Obscured]].
>
>Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.
>
>Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the [[Gust of Wind]] spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
