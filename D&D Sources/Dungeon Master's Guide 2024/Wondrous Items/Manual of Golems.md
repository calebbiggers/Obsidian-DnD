# Manual of Golems
>[!varies-wondrous-item-callout] Manual of Golems

>- - -
>_Wondrous Item, Varies_
>
>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly by rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can't use a _Manual of Golems_ and attempts to read it takes 6d6 Psychic damage.
>
>To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.
>
>Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. See the _Monster Manual_ for the golem's stat block. The golem is under your control, and it understands and obeys your commands.
