# Figurine of Wondrous Power (Serpentine Owl)
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*`=this.type`, `=this.rarity`*
>
>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a serpentine statuettes of an owl. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a **giant owl**. If the space where the owl would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the owl, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>The owl is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.
>
>The owl exists for up to 8 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 2 days have passed.
