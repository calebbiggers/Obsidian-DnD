>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from [[Mechanus]], a plane of clockwork predictability. Faint ticking and whirring noises emanate from within.
>
>When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
