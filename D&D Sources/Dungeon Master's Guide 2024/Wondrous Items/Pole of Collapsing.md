>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Pole of Collapsing
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This item functions as a [[Adventuring Gear#Pole\|Pole]]. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole's weight doesn't change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
