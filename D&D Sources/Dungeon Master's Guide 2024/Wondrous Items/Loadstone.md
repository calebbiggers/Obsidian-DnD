>***Curse.*** The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; [[Detect Magic]] doesn't detect it. An [[Identify]] spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with [[Remove Curse]] or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
