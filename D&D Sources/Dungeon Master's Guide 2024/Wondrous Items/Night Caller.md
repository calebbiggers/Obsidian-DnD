# Night Caller
>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
>
>This whistle is carved from transparent crystal, and it resembles a tiny dragon curled up like a snail. The name Night Caller is etched on the whistle in Dwarvish runes. If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check, the character recalls lore that says the duergar made several such whistles for various groups in an age past.
>
>If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the [[Animate Dead]] spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 days have passed.
>
>Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to reassert control over one or two creatures you animated with it
