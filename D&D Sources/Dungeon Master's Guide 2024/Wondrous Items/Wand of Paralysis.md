# Wand of Paralysis
>[!rare-wand-callout] Wand of Paralysis
>_Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement a Spellcaster)_
>
>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Paralyzed\|Paralyzed]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
