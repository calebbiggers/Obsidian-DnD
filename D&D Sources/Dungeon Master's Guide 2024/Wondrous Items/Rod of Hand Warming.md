# Rod of Hand Warming
>[!unknown-rarity-rod-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Rod, Unknown Rarity*

>The Rod looks like a staff about three to four feet long with a seam in the middle as if it were two pieces joined. It is faintly magical and acts like a hand warmer. When the two parts are slid together and click, the metal emanates enough heat to warm the hands of whoever's holding it.
