>*Weapon (Dagger), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by Vax’ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens. Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.
>
>***Dormant.*** While *Whisper* is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
>
>Additionally, when you score a critical hit with this dagger, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
>
>***Awakened.*** When *Whisper* reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage.
>* The DC to resist being frightened from a critical hit increases to 15.
>
>***Exalted.*** When *Whisper* reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra psychic damage it deals increases to 1d8.
>* The DC to resist being frightened from a critical hit increases to 17.
>* When this dagger is used to make a ranged attack, you can choose to transform into shadow and merge with the blade as part of the action used to attack, teleporting to another location. If the attack hits, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the target. If the attack misses, you appear where the GM determines the dagger lands (typically within 1d6 × 5 feet of the target). In either case, you appear with the dagger in your hand.
