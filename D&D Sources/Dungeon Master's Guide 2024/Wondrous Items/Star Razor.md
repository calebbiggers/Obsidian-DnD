# Star Razor
>[!legendary-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Longsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver longsword is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. *Star Razor* — known also as *Dwueth’var* — was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the Calamity, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in Wildemount.
>
>***Dormant.*** While *Star Razor* is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word *Galas-var*, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
>
>* While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.
>* You can cast the [[Faerie Fire]] spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using *Star Razor*, that spell can’t be cast from the sword until the next dawn.
>
>***Awakened.*** When *Star Razor* reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
>* When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a burst of radiance from the sword, dealing 1d8 radiant damage to the attacker.
>* You can cast the [[See Invisibility]] spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 15.
>
>***Exalted.*** When Star Razor reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
>* The burst of radiance you can create as a reaction when hit with a melee attack deals 1d12 radiant damage, and you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you as part of the same reaction.
>* You can cast the [[Fly]] spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 17.
