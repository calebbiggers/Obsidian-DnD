# Cloak of the Bat
>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] Cloak of the Bat
>_Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)_
>
>While wearing this cloak, you have Advantage on Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Stealth]]) checks. In an area of [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] or [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]], you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [[Combat#Fly Speed\|Fly Speed]] of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in Dim Light or Darkness, you lose this Fly Speed.
>
>While wearing the cloak in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast [[Polymorph]] on yourself, shape-shifting into a [[Bat]]. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
