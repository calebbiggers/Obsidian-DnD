# Potion of Growth
>[!uncommon-potion-callout] Potion of Growth
>_Potion, Uncommon_
>
>When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell for 10 minutes (no [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]] required).
>
>The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
