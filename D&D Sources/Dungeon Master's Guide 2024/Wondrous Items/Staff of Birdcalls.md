>[!common-staff-callout] Staff of Birdcalls
>_Staff, Common_
>
>This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds, which can be heard out to 120 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.
