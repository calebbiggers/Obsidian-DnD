>While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's Bright Light. You can take a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.
