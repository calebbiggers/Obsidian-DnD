>The lenses of these garish goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While wearing these lenses, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check.
>* As an action, you can use the goggles to examine an object to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. On a success, you learn the creature's type and can immediately use the goggles to cast [[Locate Creature]] to find that creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
