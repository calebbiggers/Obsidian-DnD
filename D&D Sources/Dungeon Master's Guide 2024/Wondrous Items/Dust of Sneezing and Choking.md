>Found in a small container, this powder resembles [[Dust of Disappearance]], and [[Identify]] reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.
>
>As a [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot [[Spells#Emanation\|Emanation]] originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.
>
>On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition and is [[Exploration#Suffocation\|Suffocating]]. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a [[Lesser Restoration]] spell.
