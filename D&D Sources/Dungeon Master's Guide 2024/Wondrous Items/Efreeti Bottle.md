>When you take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an [[Efreeti]] appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
>
>The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.
>
>|1d10|Effect|
>|---|---|
>|1|The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.|
>|2â€“9|The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.|
>|10|The efreeti understands your languages and can cast [[Wish]] once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.|
