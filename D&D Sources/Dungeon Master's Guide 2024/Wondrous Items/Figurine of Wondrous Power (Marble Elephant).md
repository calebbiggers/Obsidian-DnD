>[!rare-wondrous-item-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*`=this.type`, `=this.rarity`*
>
>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a marble statuettes of an elephant. It is about 4 inches high and long. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the elephant would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the elephant, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>The elephant is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the *Monster Manual* for the creature's statistics.
>
>The elephant exists for up to 24 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
