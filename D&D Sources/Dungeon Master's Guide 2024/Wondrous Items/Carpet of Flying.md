>You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.
>
>Four sizes of _Carpet of Flying_ exist. The DM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its Fly Speed is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.
