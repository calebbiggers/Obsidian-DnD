# Mind Blade
>[!rare-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Any Sword), Rare (Requires Attunement By A Specific Individual)*
>
>Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a *mind blade*. Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls. In the hands of any other creature, the mind blade functions as a normal sword of its kind. In the hands of its intended wielder, the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage to any target it hits.
