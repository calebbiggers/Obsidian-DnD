>[!varies-weapon-callout] Ammunition of Slaying
>_Weapon (Any Ammunition) , Varies_
>
>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.
>
>After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.
