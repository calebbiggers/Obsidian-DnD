>
>This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.
>
>You can use the cauldron as a Spellcasting Focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [[Scrying]] spell.
>
>**_Brew Potion._** When you finish a Long Rest, you can use the cauldron to create a [[Potion of Healing (greater)]], which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.
>
>**_Raise Dead._** As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.
>
>If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [[Raise Dead]] at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.
