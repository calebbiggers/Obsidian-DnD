>***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon. Whenever you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 1 on the attack roll, you suffer the effect of a [[Polymorph]] spell for 1 hour, rolling on the table to determine your new form.
