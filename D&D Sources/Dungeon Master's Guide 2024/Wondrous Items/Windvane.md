# Windvane
>[!legendary-weapon-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Weapon (Spear), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
>
>A silver spear, *Windvane* has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air.

>***Song of the Four Winds.*** While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using *Windvane* to create a *devastation orb of air* (see the [[Devastation Orb]] description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, *Windvane* can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.
