>[!uncommon-wand-callout] Wand of Magic Missiles
>_Wand, Uncommon_
>
>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [[Magic Missile]] from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
