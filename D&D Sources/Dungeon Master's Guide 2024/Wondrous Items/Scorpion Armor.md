# Scorpion Armor
>[!rare-armor-callout] `=this.file.name`
>*Armor (Plate), Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:
>
>* The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated.
>* The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
>* The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).
>
>***Curse.*** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10 + 45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [[Wish]] spell can remove the armor's curse.
