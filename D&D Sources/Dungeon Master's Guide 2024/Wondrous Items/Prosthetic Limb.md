# Prosthetic Limb
>[!common-wondrous-item-callout] Prosthetic Limb
>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This magic item replaces a lost limbâ€”a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, and it can't be removed against your will while you are alive.
