> This flat, gray-and-black river stone is shaped like a cat’s head and inscribed with an unknown arcane symbol. It feels cool to the touch. While carrying the stone, you can gain [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on one ability check of your choice. The stone can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
