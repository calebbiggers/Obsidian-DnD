# Loxodon
![[Guildmasters-Guide-To-Ravnica-Banner.jpg|banner]]![[loxodon.png|float-right|300]]The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.

Loxodons physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they live about 450 years. They highly value the weight of wisdom and experience and are considered young until they reach the age of 60.
## Loxodon Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 7–8 feet tall) 
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Loxodon, you have these special traits.
>**_Powerful Build._** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>**_Loxodon Serenity._** You have advantage on saving throws against being [[Conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened|Frightened]].
>
>**_Natural Armor._** You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
>
>**_Trunk._** You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.
>
>Your trunk can’t wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.
>
>**_Keen Smell._** Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[#Perception]]), Wisdom ([[#Survival]]), and Intelligence ([[#Investigation]]) checks that involve smell.
