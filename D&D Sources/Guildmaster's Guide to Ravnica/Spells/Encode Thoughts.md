# Encode Thoughts
>[!spell-callout] Encode Thoughts
>_Enchantment Cantrip (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** S
>**Duration:** 8 Hours
>
>You pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.
>
>If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as *[[Detect Thoughts]]* or *[[Modify Memory]]*), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.
>
>Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting *detect thoughts* on the strand has the same effect.)
