# Wheel of Stars
>[!very-rare-wondrous-item-callout] Wheel of Stars
>*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the [[Dancing Lights]], [[Guidance]], or [[Message]] cantrips.
>
>***Portent of the Stars.*** As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a d10 and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the *wheel of stars*, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
>
>***Alter Gravity.*** As an action, you can cast [[Fly]] on yourself or you can cast [[Levitate]] (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the *wheel of stars*, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
>
>***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the [[Orrery of The Wanderer]], its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
