>[!spell-callout] Jim's Magic Missile
>_Level 1 Evocation (Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 Feet
>**Components:** V, S, M (1 gold coin, which is consumed as tax for using the spell)
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>You create three twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart can target a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, the missile does 2d4 force damage.
>
>If the attack roll scores a critical, the missile does 5d4 force damage instead of the 4d4 force that you would normally get on a critical. If any of the attack roll is a natural one, all missiles turn around and hit the caster for 1 force damage per missile.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1. This also increases the tax by 1 Gp per spell slot over 1.
