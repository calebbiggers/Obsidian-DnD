# Shadar-Kai
![[shadar-kai-image.png|float-right|300]]Shadar-kai are the elves of the Shadowfell, originally drawn to that dread realm by [[The Raven Queen]]. Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies.

Once shadar-kai were Fey like the rest of their elven kin; now they exist in a state between life and death, thanks to being transformed by the Shadowfell’s grim energy.

Shadar-kai have ashen skin tones, and while they’re in the Shadowfell, they also become wizened, reflecting the somber nature of that gloomy plane.
