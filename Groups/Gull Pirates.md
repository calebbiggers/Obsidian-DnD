# The Gull Pirates

The Gull Pirates were an aspiring pirate crew who entered the tempest 30-or-so years ago. One of the first things they did was attempt to hunt down a member of the [[Storm Wardens]]. They tracked a group of Storm Wardens to a remote island where [[Overgrown Storm Warden Temple|a temple]] was located.

Upon attempting to enter the temple, they encountered the [[Four Storms Puzzle]]. They failed and were trapped inside the entrance and killed by a [[Greater Water Elemental]]. Their corpses are still there to this day.
