# The Tide Syndicate

The tide syndicate is a group of smugglers who operate in the area of ocean where the [[Tranquil Refuge Archipelago]] is located. Their main base of operations is a secret cave dock under the [[The Alchemist's Home]] near [[Saltmarsh]].

The Tide Syndicate was hired by the [[The Whisper Pirates]] to smuggle their goods outside the tempest.

Their main mode of transportation is [[The Peggy-Lou]], a small sloop.
