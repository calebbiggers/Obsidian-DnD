>As an action, you can attach the token to a suit of armor or a shield or remove it. While you wear the token, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. You can also use your [[Paladin#Level 2 Channel Divinity|Channel Divinity]] feature without expending one of the feature’s uses. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
>
>Additionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a [[Damage & Healing#Critical Hits|Critical Hit]] while you’re wearing the armor or wielding the shield that bears the token, you can use your reaction to expend 1 use of your Channel Divinity feature to turn the critical hit into a normal hit instead.
