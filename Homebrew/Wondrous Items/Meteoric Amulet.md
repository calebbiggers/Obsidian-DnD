>This amulet is fashioned from a mysterious meteor shard originating from an otherworldly realm. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.
>
>_**Spellcasting Focus.**_ You can use the amulet as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.
>
>_**Unknown Spell.**_ As a [[Actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip or level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell must be on the Warlock spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can’t have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make a Charisma (Arcana) check (DC = 10 plus the spell’s base level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time at the level of your Warlock spell slots. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the [[Wild Magic Sorcery#Wild Magic Surge Table|Wild Magic Surge Table]]. Regardless of if you succeed or fail, you can’t use this property again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]]

>Any spell you cast from the amulet uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
