>*Wondrous Item, Rare*
>
> Toothy is a tame mimic created by a powerful wizard named [[NPCs#Master Elrikor Galanodel|Master Elrikor]], a mimic researcher in [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate]]
> 
> _**Sentience.**_ Toothy is a sentient neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 8. It has hearing and dark-vision out to a range of 60 feet. Toothy can understand Common.
> 
> _**Personality.**_ Toothy is simple-minded, and primarily interested in eating. So long as Toothy believes its wielder will provide it with an ample supply of raw meat, it will gladly follow its wielder's orders. If Toothy goes three or more days without being fed any raw meat, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.
> 
> _**Shapechanger.**_ While attuned to this item, you can use an action to command it to change its form to one of the following options:
> - **Weapon.** Toothy transforms into a simple or martial melee weapon of your choice. You are considered proficient with the weapon if you were not already. When you hit a Large or smaller target with Toothy while it is in this form, you can use a bonus action to attempt to restrain the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained. The target can re-attempt the saving throw as an action, ending the effect on itself on a success. While Toothy has a target restrained in this way, it cannot be used to make attack rolls against any other targets. You can command Toothy to release a restrained creature at any time without requiring an action
> - **Shield.** Toothy transforms into a shield. You are considered proficient with the shield if you were not already. When a Large or smaller creature misses you with a melee attack while Toothy is in this form, you can use your reaction to attempt to restrain the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained. The creature can re-attempt the saving throw as an action, ending the effect on itself on a success. While Toothy has a creature restrained in this way, it provides no bonus to your AC. You can command Toothy to release a restrained creature at any time without requiring an action.
> - **Other Item.** Toothy takes the form of any non-magical object no larger than Medium and worth no more than 100 GP. Toothy can transform into a duplicate of a non-magical object, such as a key, if you possess the original.
