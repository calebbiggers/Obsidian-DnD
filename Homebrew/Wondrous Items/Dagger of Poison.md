>You can use an action to cause sickly, green poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and become [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
