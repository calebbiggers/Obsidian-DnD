>- - -
>_Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)_
>
>When you make a [[D20 Tests|D20 Test]]—before the result is determined—you can use this ring to store the number rolled. You then roll a d20 again and use the new roll. The stored roll remains in the ring for up to 24 hours. You may only have one roll stored in the ring at a time.
>
>***Fates Decree:*** At any point while you have a roll stored, the DM can decide to apply the stored roll to any D20 Test that you make, but must do so before you roll. You can beseech the fates to unleash the stored roll for a specific instance,but they rarely answer to the whims of mortals.
