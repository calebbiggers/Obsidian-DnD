> Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features the toothy maw of a kraken.
>
> ***Tattoo Attunement.*** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.
>
> ***Frightening Roar.*** As a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]] you can cause a menacing roar to emanate from the tattoo. Any creature within 30 ft of you must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [[Conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] of you for 1 minute or until it takes damage from you. Any frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
