> A node compass is a type of magical device that allows travel between islands within [[The Wild Tempest]]. Also called a “Blacktide compass", after [[Christof Blacktide]], an adventurer and explorer who was the first to map a route from Baldur’s gate to Waterdeep.
>
> The node compass can only point to one island at a time. Starting from [[Baldur's Gate]] the compass points to islands sequentially, eventually reaching [[Waterdeep]]. In order to lock onto the next island in the sequence, the node compass must be kept on the current island for an amount of time dependent on the island.
