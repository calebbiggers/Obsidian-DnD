>---
> *Wondrous Item (Tattoo), Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
> Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features an illustration of an open eye.
>
> ***Tattoo Attunement.*** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.
>
> ***Darksight.*** While attuned to this item, you can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness—both magical and nonmagical—within 60 feet of yourself.
