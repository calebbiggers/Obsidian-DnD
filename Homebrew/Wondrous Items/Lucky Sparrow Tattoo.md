>
> Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features three sparrows flying through the air.
>
> ***Tattoo Attunement.*** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.
>
> ***Lucky Sparrows.*** You have three lucky sparrows visible on the tattoo. You may spend these sparrows on the benefits listed below. Once you use a sparrow, it disappears from the tattoo. You regain a sparrow upon landing a critical hit on any attack roll.
>
> ***Lucky Hit.*** Whenever you make an attack roll, you can spend one sparrow to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your sparrows after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll.
