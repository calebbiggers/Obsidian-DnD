# Dragon Tortle

![[Homebrew-Banner.jpg|banner]]The ancestors of Dragon Tortles are believed to have been born from the eggs of ancient Dragon Turtles. One legend claims these eggs were blessed by powerful sea deities, granting the Dragon Tortles the ability to traverse both land and sea. Another story holds that Dragon Turtles themselves gave rise to the first Dragon Tortles, creating a people with strength, wisdom, and a deep connection to the ocean. Regardless of their origins, Dragon Tortles are rare and nomadic, wandering the coasts and waterways of the Material Plane.

Dragon Tortles resemble their dragon turtle ancestors, with thick, scaled skin, bright eyes, and a large, protective shell on their backs. They are larger than standard Tortles, and their amphibious nature allows them to thrive both on land and in the sea, making them formidable and adaptable beings.

## Dragon Tortle Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Dragon Tortle, you have these special traits.
>**_Breath Weapon._** When you take the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of scalding steam in either a 15-foot [[#Cone]] or a 30-foot [[#Line]] that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 fire damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests\|Long Rest]].

>**_Amphibious._** You can breathe air and water.
>
>**_Natural Armor._** Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can’t wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.
>
>**_Shell Defense._** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are [[Conditions#Prone|Prone]], your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can’t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
