>This clockwork device resembles a metal crab the size of a dinner plate. Every action used to wind up the device allows it to operate for 1 minute, to a maximum of 10 minutes. While operational, the item uses the accompanying **vox seeker** stat block. This automaton is under the DM's control. A vox seeker reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.
