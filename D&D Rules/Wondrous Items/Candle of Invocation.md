>This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.
>
>While lit, the candle sheds [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on [[D20 Tests]]. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.
>
>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [[Gate]] with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.
