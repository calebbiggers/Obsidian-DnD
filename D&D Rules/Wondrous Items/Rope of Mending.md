>_Wondrous Item, Common_
>
>This 50-foot coil of rope can repair itself when cut into any number of smaller pieces. As a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, you can cause all pieces of the rope that are in contact with each other and not otherwise in use to knit back together. A _Rope of Mending_ is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed.
