>[!uncommon-wondrous-item-callout] Pipes of Haunting
>_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_
>
>These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours.
