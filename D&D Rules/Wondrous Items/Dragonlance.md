>A *dragonlance* is a renowned weapon forged from rare metal with the aid of powerful artifacts. On Krynn, its creation is associated with the god Paladine and legendary heroes who fought against the evil of the Dragon Queen. Different lances are forged for use by foot soldiers (as pikes) and by riders (as lances), but the magical properties of the weapons are the same.
