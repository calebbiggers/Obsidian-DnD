>*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*
>
>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
>
>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff is destroyed in an otherwise harmless burst of eldritch energy.
>
>**Eldritch Attack.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage.
>
>**Eldritch Escape.** If you take damage while holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of the staff's charges, whereupon you turn invisible and teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or deal damage.
