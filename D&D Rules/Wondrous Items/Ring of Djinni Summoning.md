>[!legendary-ring-callout] Ring of Djinni Summoning
>_Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)_
>
>While wearing this ring, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to summon a particular [[Djinni]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of yourself. It remains as long as you maintain [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 Hit Points.
>
>While summoned, the djinni is [[Social Interaction#Friendly\|Friendly]] to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.
>
>After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.
>
>_Rings of Djinni Summoning_ are often created by the djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of friendship or tokens of esteem.
