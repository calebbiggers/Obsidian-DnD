>
>Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The book's metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one metal to another. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[Enlarge-Reduce]], [[Feather Fall]], [[Flesh To Stone]], [[Gaseous Form]], [[Magic Weapon]], and [[Polymorph]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.
>
>While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
>
>The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:
>
>* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.
>* As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.
