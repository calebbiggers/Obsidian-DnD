>This Tiny cube looks like a jack-in-the-box. When you wind its crank as a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action, a merry tune emits from the box, the lid pops open, a creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space, and the lid closes. The lid can't otherwise be opened.
>
>Roll on the Cube of Summoning table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 (save DC 17, +9 attack bonus) and doesn't require [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], but you otherwise function as the spell's caster.
>
>Once the cube summons a creature, the cube can't do so again until the next dawn.
