>The chariot's riders and creatures pulling the chariot gain a +1 bonus to their AC.
>
>If this magic chariot is pulled by one or more flying creatures, it too can fly.
>
>**Chariots**
>
>*Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the* Player's Handbook*, but with the following differences:*
>
>* *Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.*
>* *Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.*
>* *A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.*
>* *If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.*
