>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast [[Charm Person]] (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
