>[!legendary-wondrous-item-callout] Sphere of Annihilation
>_Wondrous Item, Legendary_
>
>Sphere of Annihilation
>
>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
>
>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a _Sphere of Annihilation_, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
>
>**_Controlling the Sphere._** A _Sphere of Annihilation_ is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to make a DC 25 Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.
>
>While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.
>
>**_Sphere Interactions._** If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the [[Gate]] spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a [[Portable Hole]]), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.
>
>|1d100|Result|
>|---|---|
>|01–50|The sphere is destroyed.|
>|51–85|The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.|
>|86–00|A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence.|
