>[!rare-ring-callout] Ring of X-ray Vision
>_Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)_
>
>While wearing this ring, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.
>
>Whenever you use the ring again before taking a Long Rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Conditions#Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] level.
