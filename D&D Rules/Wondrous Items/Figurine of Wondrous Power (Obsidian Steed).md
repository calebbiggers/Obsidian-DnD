>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a polished obsidian statuettes of a horse. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a **nightmare**. If the space where the elephant would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the elephant, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.
>
>The nightmare exists for up to 24 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 5 days have passed.
