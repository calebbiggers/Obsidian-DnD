>_Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow) , Varies (Requires Attunement)_
>
>When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: “Swift death to you who have wronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
>
>When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from [[Combat#Half Cover\|Half Cover]] or [[Combat#Three-Quarters Cover\|Three-Quarters Cover]], and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage.
>
>While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
