>
>A restless spirit is trapped inside this lantern. While holding the lantern, you can command the spirit as a bonus action to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
>
>While holding the lantern, you can use an action to order the spirit to leave the lantern and duplicate the effect of the [[Mage Hand]] spell. The spirit returns to the lantern when the spell ends.
>
>If you fall unconscious within 10 feet of the lantern, the spirit emerges from it, magically stabilizes you with a touch, and then quickly returns to the lantern.
>
>The spirit is bound to the lantern and can't be harmed, turned, or raised from the dead. Casting a [[Dispel Evil And Good]] spell on the lantern releases the spirit to the afterlife and renders the lantern nonmagical.
