>[!varies-staff-callout] Enspelled Staff
>_Staff, Varies (Requires Attunement a Spellcaster)_
>
>Bound into this staff is a spell of level 8 or lower. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [[Quarterstaff]].
>
>The level of the spell bound into the staff determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the staff's rarity, as shown in the following table.
