>These steel crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the Scattered War, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the Houses of Kraghammer. *Cataclysm bolts* are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a *cataclysm bolt*, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect.

>| d6 | Effect |
>| --- | --- |
>| 1-2 | The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it. |
>| 3-4 | The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn. |
>| 5 | The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. |
>| 6 | The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit. |
>
>Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.
