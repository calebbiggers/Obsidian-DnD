>[!rare-weapon-callout] Mace of Terror
>_Weapon (Mace) , Rare (Requires Attunement)_
>
>This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make [[Combat#Opportunity Attacks\|Opportunity Attacks]]. For its action, it can use only the [[Actions#Dash\|Dash]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the [[Actions#Dodge\|Dodge]] action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
