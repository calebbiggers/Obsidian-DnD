>Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe Jived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and be lived underground. in battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first *blood spear*, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.
