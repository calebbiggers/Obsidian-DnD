>This *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a serpentine statuettes of an raven. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a **raven**. If the space where the raven would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the raven, the figurine doesn't become a creature. 
>
>The raven is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the [[Animal Messenger]] spell on it at will.
>
>The raven exists for up to 12 hours. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until 2 days have passed.
