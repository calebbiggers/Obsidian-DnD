>[!rare-staff-callout] Staff of Charming
>_Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)_
>
>This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:
>
>**Cast Spell.** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast [[Charm Person]], [[Command]], or [[Comprehend Languages]] from it using your spell save DC.
>
>**Reflect Enchantment.** If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.
>
>**Resist Enchantment.** If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.
>
>**_Regaining Charges._** The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
