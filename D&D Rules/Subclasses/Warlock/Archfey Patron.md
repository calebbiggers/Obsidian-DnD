![[players-handbook-banner-2024.png|banner]]![[archfey-patron.png|float-right|300]]Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.
# Level 3: Archfey Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

# Level 3: Steps of the Fey
Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [[Misty Step]] without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]].

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.
>**_Refreshing Step._** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 [[Damage & Healing#Temporary Hit Points\|Temporary Hit Points]].
>
>**_Taunting Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

# Level 6: Misty Escape
You can cast [[Misty Step]] as a Reaction in response to taking damage.

In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.
>**_Disappearing Step._** You have the [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
>
>**_Dreadful Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.
# Level 10: Beguiling Defenses
Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]] unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.
# Level 14: Bewitching Magic
Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [[Misty Step]] as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
