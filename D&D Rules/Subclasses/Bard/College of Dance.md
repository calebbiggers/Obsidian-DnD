![[players-handbook-banner-2024.png|banner]]![[college-of-dance.png|float-right|300]]Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can’t be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.
# Level 3: Dazzling Footwork
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits.
>**_Dance Virtuoso._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on any Charisma ([[#Performance]]) check you make that involves you dancing.
>
>**_Unarmored Defense._** Your base [[D20 Tests#Armor Class\|Armor Class]] equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.
>
>**_Agile Strikes._** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes\|Unarmed Strike]] as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.
>
>**_Bardic Damage._** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes\|Unarmed Strikes]]. When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike’s normal damage. This roll doesn’t expend the die.
# Level 6: Inspiring Movement
When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.

None of this feature’s movement provokes [[Combat#Opportunity Attacks\|Opportunity Attacks]].
# Level 6: Tandem Footwork
When you roll [[Combat#Initiative\|Initiative]], you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don’t have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to Initiative equal to the number rolled.
# Level 14: Leading Evasion
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can’t use this feature if you have the [[Conditions#Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition.
