![[players-handbook-banner-2024.png|banner]]![[hunter.png|float-right|300]]You stalk prey in the wilds and elsewhere, using your abilities as a Hunter to protect nature and people everywhere from forces that would destroy them.

# Level 3: Hunter’s Lore
You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your [[Hunter’s Mark]], you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.
# Level 3: Hunter’s Prey
You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Short Rests\|Short]] or [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]], you can replace the chosen option with the other one.
>**_Colossus Slayer._** Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage to the target if it’s missing any of its Hit Points. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
>
>**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, that is within the weapon’s range, and that you haven’t attacked this turn.
# Level 7: Defensive Tactics
You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Short Rests\|Short]] or [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]], you can replace the chosen option with the other one.
>**_Escape the Horde._** [[Combat#Opportunity Attacks\|Opportunity Attacks]] have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] against you.
>
>**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on all other attack rolls against you this turn.
# Level 11: Superior Hunter’s Prey
Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature marked by your [[Hunter’s Mark]], you can also deal that spell’s extra damage to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature.
# Level 15: Superior Hunter’s Defense
When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to give yourself Resistance to that damage and any other damage of the same type until the end of the current turn.
