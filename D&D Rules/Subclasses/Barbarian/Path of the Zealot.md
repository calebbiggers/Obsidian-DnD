![[players-handbook-banner-2024.png|banner]]![[path-of-the-zealot.png|float-right|300]]Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of divine union that infuses them with power. They are often allies to the priests and other followers of their god or pantheon.
# Level 3: Divine Fury
You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.
# Level 3: Warrior of the Gods
A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the fight. You have a pool of four d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.

The pool’s maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).
# Level 6: Fanatical Focus
Once per active Rage, if you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and you must use the new roll.
# Level 10: Zealous Presence
As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.
# Level 14: Rage of the Gods
When you activate your Rage, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

While in this form, you gain the benefits below.

>**_Flight._** You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.
>
>**_Resistance._** You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage.
>
>**_Revivification._** When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Rage to instead change the target’s Hit Points to a number equal to your Barbarian level.
