>**_Two Cantrips._** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[Cleric]], [[Druid]], or [[Wizard]] spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells (choose when you select this feat).

You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
