>[!feat] Crossbow Expert
>_General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Dexterity 13+)_
>
>You gain the following benefits.
>
>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Ignore Loading._** You ignore the [[Weapons#Loading\|Loading]] property of the Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Light Crossbow (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you’re holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand.
>
>**_Firing in Melee._** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on your attack rolls with crossbows.
>
>**_Dual Wielding._** When you make the extra attack of the [[Weapons#Light\|Light]] property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the Light property and you aren’t already adding that modifier to the damage.
