>When you hit with your [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes\|Unarmed Strike]] and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. If you arenâ€™t holding any weapons or a Shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
>
>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 Bludgeoning damage to one creature [[Conditions#Grappled\|Grappled]] by you.
