>[!feat] Shadow-Touched
>_General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)_
>
>Your exposure to the Shadowfell’s magic grants you the following benefits.
>
>**_Ability Score Increase._** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
>**_Shadow Magic._** Choose one level 1 spell from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic. You always have that spell and the [[Invisibility]] spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests\|Long Rest]]. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
