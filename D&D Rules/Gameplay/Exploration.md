Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.
# Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with [[Tools#Thieves’ Tools|Thieves' Tools]], and create obstacles for pursuers with [[Adventuring Gear#Caltrops|Caltrops]].

# Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below.
## Obscured Areas
### Lightly Obscured
>In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.
### Heavily Obscured
>A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. You have the [[Conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition when trying to see something there.
## Light
The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below.
### Bright Light
>Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.
### Dim Light
>Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a [[#Lightly Obscured]] area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.
### Darkness
>Darkness creates a [[#Heavily Obscured]] area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
## Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. The rules glossary defines the following special senses:
### Blindsight
>If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn’t behind [[Combat#Total Cover\|Total Cover]] even if you have the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] condition or are in [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]]. Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] condition.
### Darkvision
If you have Darkvision, you can see in [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] within a specified range as if it were [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] and in [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]] within that range as if it were Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness only as shades of gray.
### Tremorsense
>A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
>
>Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.
### Truesight
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:
>**Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical [[Exploration#Darkness\|Darkness]].
>
>**Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the [[Conditions#Invisible\|Invisible]] condition.
>
>**Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.
>
>**Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.
>
>**Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.
# Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Dungeon Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the [[Actions#Hide\|Hide]] action.
# Interacting with Objects
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections.
## What Is an Object?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.
## Time-Limited Object Interactions
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action.
## Finding Hidden Objects
When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]]) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.

If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]]) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.
## Carrying Objects
You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for [[#carrying capacity]] in the [[#rules glossary]].
## Breaking Objects
Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the [[Actions#Attack\|Attack]] or [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action.

>**_Armor Class._** The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances.
>
>### Object Armor Class
>| AC  | Substance           |
>|:--- | ------------------- |
>| 11  | Cloth, paper, rope  |
> 13  | Crystal, glass, ice |
>| 15  | Wood                |
>| 17  | Stone               |
> 19  | Iron, steel         |
>| 21  | Mithral             |
>| 23  | Adamantine          |
>
>**_Hit Points._** An object is destroyed when it has 0 [[Damage & Healing#Hit Points\|Hit Points]]. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.
>
>### Object Hit Points
>| Size                        | Fragile  | Resilient |
>|:--------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
>| Tiny (bottle, lock)         | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |
> Small (chest, lute)         | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |
>| Medium (barrel, chandelier) | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |
>| Large (cart, dining table)  | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |
>
>**_Damage Types and Objects._** Objects have [[Damage & Healing#Immunity\|Immunity]] to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage.
>
>**_Damage Threshold._** Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold.
>
>**_No Ability Scores._** An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws.
# Hazards
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but other dangers await. The rules glossary defines the following hazards:

## Burning
>A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.
## Dehydration
>A creature requires an amount of water per day based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the required water for a day gains 1 Exhaustion level at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydration can’t be removed until the creature drinks the full amount of water required for a day.
>### Water Needs per Day
>|Size|Water|
>|---|---|
>|Tiny|1/4 gallon|
>Small|1 gallon|
>|Medium|1 gallon|
>|Large|4 gallons|
>|Huge|16 gallons|
>|Gargantuan|64 gallons|
## Falling
>A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it has the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.
>
>A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its [[Actions#Reactions|Reaction]] to make a DC 15 Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) or Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Acrobatics]]) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.
## Malnutrition
>A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.
>
>Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day. 
>
>### Food Needs per Day
>|Size|Food|
>|---|---|
>|Tiny|1/4 pound|
>|Small|1 pound|
>|Medium|1 pound|
>|Large|4 pounds|
>|Huge|16 pounds|
>|Gargantuan|64 pounds|
## Suffocation
>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains 1 [[Conditions#Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] level at the end of each of its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from suffocating.
# Travel
During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
## Marching Order
The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.
## Travel Pace
While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a [[Damage & Healing#Short Rests\|Short]] or [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests\|Long Rest]] before they can move at that increased pace again.

| Distance Traveled Per... |          |         |          |
|:------------------------ | -------- |:------- |:-------- |
| Pace                     | Minute   | Hour    | Day      |
| -                        | -        | -       | -        |
| Fast                     | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal                   | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow                     | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.

>**_Fast._** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on a traveler’s Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]] or [[Proficiency#Skill List\|Survival]]) and Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Stealth]]) checks.
>
>**_Normal._** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Stealth]]) checks.
>
>**_Slow._** Traveling at a Slow pace grants [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]] or [[Proficiency#Skill List\|Survival]]) checks.

## Vehicles
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
