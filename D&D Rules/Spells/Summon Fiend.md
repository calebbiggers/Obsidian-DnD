>![[fiendish-spirit.png|float-right|300]]You call forth a fiendish spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Fiendish Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature resembles a Fiend of the chosen type, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[Actions#Dodge\|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
