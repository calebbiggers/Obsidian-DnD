>[!spell-callout] Prismatic Spray
>_Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)_
>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot [[Spells#Cone\|Cone]]. Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.
>
>#### Prismatic Rays
>|1d8|Ray|
>|---|---|
>|1|**Red.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Fire damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.|
>|2|**Orange.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Acid damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.|
>|3|**Yellow.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Lightning damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.|
>|4|**Green.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Poison damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.|
>|5|**Blue.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Cold damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.|
>|6|**Indigo.** _Failed Save:_ The target has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [[Conditions#Petrified\|Petrified]] condition until it is freed by an effect like the [[Greater Restoration]] spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.|
>|7|**Violet.** _Failed Save:_ The target has the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice).|
>|8|**Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8.|
