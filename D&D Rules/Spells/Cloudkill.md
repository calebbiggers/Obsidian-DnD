>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 120 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 10 minutes
>
>You create a 20-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind]]) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [[Exploration#Heavily Obscured\|Heavily Obscured]].
>
>Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
>
>The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
