>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)

>Each creature in a 30-foot [[Spells#Cone\|Cone]] must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] condition for the duration.

>A Frightened creature takes the [[Actions#Dash\|Dash]] action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move.
