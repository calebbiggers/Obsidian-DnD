>The ground in a 20-foot-radius [[Spells#Sphere\|Sphere]] centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]] for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

>The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a [[Actions#Search\|Search]] action and succeed on a Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]] or [[Proficiency#Skill List\|Survival]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
