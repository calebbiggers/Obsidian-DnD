>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** Self
>**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP)
>**Duration:** [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]], up to 1 hour

>You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.
>
>When you shape-shift, you gain a number of [[Damage & Healing#Temporary Hit Points\|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to the Hit Points of the form. The spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points left.
>
>Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.
>
>Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.
