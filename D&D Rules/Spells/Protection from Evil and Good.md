>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [[possessed]] by or gain the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
