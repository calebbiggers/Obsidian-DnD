>Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:
>
>* You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).
>* You are immune to the poisoned condition (Lower Planes) or the charmed condition (Upper Planes).
>* Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.
>* You have a +2 bonus to AC.
>* All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spell casting ability modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.
>* You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.
