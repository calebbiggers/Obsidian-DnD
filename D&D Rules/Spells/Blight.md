>
>**Casting Time:** Action
>**Range:** 30 feet
>**Components:** V, S
>**Duration:** Instantaneous
>
>A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.
>
>Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.
>
>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
