>**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]] on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.
