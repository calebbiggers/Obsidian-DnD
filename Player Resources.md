# Player Resources

As we transition away from using D&D Beyond and begin using physical character sheets, I’ve compiled a bunch of resources for the various things you may need for our campaign. If there is anything that I missed or that you need, please let me know.

## Basic Character Sheets

Everyone will need a basic character sheet. With the release of D&D 5e 2024, there is a new official character sheet for D&D. It vastly improves upon the older 5e version in my opinion so I’d recommend using it. There are many ways to customize and streamline you character sheet for ease of use that this document will cover, but everyone will first need one of these filled out.
- [D&D 5e 2024 Character Sheet PDF](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/downloads/DnD_2024_Character-Sheet.pdf)
- [Old 5e Character Sheet PDF](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf)

### Filling Out Your Character Sheet

To fill out your character sheet, an easy way is to generate one from your D&D Beyond character. You can go to your [characters page on D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters) → Select Your Character → Click “Manage” → Click “Export to PDF”. This sheet uses the old format though, so I’d recommend copying its info to a new [5e 2024 sheet](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/downloads/DnD_2024_Character-Sheet.pdf).

>[!warning] Recommendation
>Just using the D&D Beyond generator and copying it is very easy, but I’d recommend manually filling out your character sheet as if you were building your character at level 7 from scratch. This will help you to understand where your stats come from. It’s daunting at first, but it’s not very complicated once you get it down. I have recently found that when I hand-write a character sheet, it’s much easier to remember my abilities and such.

>Plus having physical sheets allows you to have a much higher amount of customization to create your own tools that best help you.

There are many resources for help with filling out your character sheet manually:
-  [D&D Player Handbook Section](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character) - A written guide straight from the players handbook. You should have access to this link if you’re a part of our campaign on D&D Beyond.
- [[Filling Out a Character Sheet]] - A guide specifically for our campaign by me (I tried 😅).
- [D&D Character Sheet Example](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-character-sheet-examples/) - Another written guide.
- [Let’s Make a 2024 D&D Character](https://youtu.be/TkJjy7WwrVM?si=v6SoMu1IWrl6EXcN) - A video guide made by Ginny Di; a D&D YouTuber. This video is also kind of a review of the new D&D version but it’s still helpful. (To follow along, she is using the [2024 Players Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024))

## Custom Character Sheets/Binders/Organizers

In addition to your basic character sheet, one thing you can do to help yourself is create a custom character sheet. This can both help you remember your abilities/stats, and give you to an avenue to show your characters personality.
- [Making D&D Character Sheet Mini Books](https://youtu.be/JjXCQQoODXk?si=jIT7zHjLgVx68Sqg) - A video by JP Coovert. He goes over creating a simple little booklet for a character.

- [Let’s Make a D&D Character Journal](https://youtu.be/EzoU_lzgi0s?si=D6Gg4IxvyED9QH7D) - Another video by Ginny Di. This is an extremely extra example, but it does show some cool ways to customize your character sheet into a binder format.

- [Backpack Inventory Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WTwxxdHWde4HukPHs0EA-6eaeTDN7ghY/view?usp=drivesdk) - A backpack styled inventory tracker sheet made by me

## Item Cards

![[item-cards-example.jpg|border]]

Whenever someone obtains an item in our campaign, I will hand them a physical item card. This allows everyone to physically keep track of what items they have, and what they all do. If there are any other items you’d like an item card for, you can just let me know and I can make one.

Additionally, any items I add to our campaign can be found by searching their name on this website. Sometimes these pages will have additional non-mechanical details that I couldn’t fit on the card.

## Spell Cards

Like Item Cards, if you are a spellcaster, you can create Spell Cards. They could contain the spell names, what each spell does, and any other information you think you need. This allows you to better keep track of what spells you have. I have not made any spell cards, but anyone is welcome to make their own. If someone wants help just let me know.

## Dice

I have plenty of extra dice for anyone to use for our campaign. So no one needs to go and buy dice. Dice that match your character are cool, but in no way necessary. If you do want to buy dice I have some options here.
- [Cheap Colored Dice](https://a.co/d/ebSqAMI) - A 3$ set of D&D dice I found.
- [Not Amazon](https://dnddice.com/) - This site has some cheap options for colored dice. They also have more expensive and fancier dice if you’re interested.

## Notes

Anyone is welcome and encouraged to keep their own notes. I will be updating the various pages on this website before/after every session. You can view [[NPCs]], [[The World of Marinthalis|Locations]], Items, [[The Party|Player Characters]], and more. I will also be continuously updating the [[Ship's Log#Confronting Shirina|Ship’s Log]], which has a session-by-session summary of everything that has happened in our campaign.

## Books

If you are a part of our D&D Beyond campaign you should have access to any of the digital D&D books that I have there. The most useful of which is [The Players Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/). If for some reason you don't have access, I can help figure it out.

Additionally, on this website, under the _D&D Rules_ folder, you’ll find info on Gameplay, Classes, Subclasses, Lineages, Magic Items, Tools, & Equipment. These pages are tailored specifically for our campaign, so there may be some changes from the core rules.

## Other

If anyone else needs any sort of help organizing their character stuff, I am down to help. As an example, I created this laminated one pager for Kate to keep track of her characters options. The small boxes can be marked off with dry erase marker to keep track of how many uses of each ability one has.
