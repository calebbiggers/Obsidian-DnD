## Calculating Xp for a Monster

XP seems to be roughly set to $dpr * HP$. This will correlate to the total damage the monster can do, which is dpr x how many rounds the creature lives.

>$dpr * 2/3 * HP = XP$

Assume 2/3 of attacks hit.

>Orc: $9 damage * 2/3 * 15 hp = 90 xp$ - actual CR 1/2, 100 xp
>
>Barbed devil: $22 damage * 2/3 * 110 hp = 1613 xp$ - actual CR 5, 1800 xp
>
>Roc: $50 damage * 2/3 * 248 hp = 8267 xp$ - actual CR. 11, 7200 xp.

Some monsters vary from this due to resistances, special powers, and how hard Wizards wants to make them.
